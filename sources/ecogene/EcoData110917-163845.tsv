The etoposide-induced protein 2.4 family (EI24, PF0726), formerly known as DUF540, is named after the eukaryotic EI24 protein induced by the cytotoxic drug etoposide; ei24 is a p53 response gene involved in growth suppression and apoptosis (Gu, 2000). CysZ is an inner membrane protein with the C-terminus in the cytoplasm (Daley, 2005). otherPDB (I. loihiensis): 3TX3.	1788753	P0A6J3	b2413	7953	JW2406	Null

MepM(YebA) is needed for normal septation; mepM(yebA) mutants are more resistant to ampicillin, have septal defects and alleviate the growth defects associated with amiC, ampD and other murein hydrolases (Babu, 2011). NlpD, YgeR, MepM(YebA) and EnvC are members of the M23 clan of predicted metallopeptidases that have C-terminal LytM domains; mutating all four LytM domain genes produces a strain with a severe filamentous phenotype, similar to an amiABC triple mutant, of over 20 times the normal cell length and more than 70 times the normal amount of septa/cell, from 0.5 to 36 septa/cell; also similar to the amiABC mutant, the nlpD-envC-mepM(yebA)-ygeR mutant has altered morphology and delayed onset of lysis after beta-lactam antibiotic treatment (Uehara, 2009). MepM(YebA) must be in the periplasm as that is where its substrate is, but SignalP does not indicate a signal peptide cleavage site; nonetheless there is a single predicted transmembrane segment at positions 21-40 that likely serves as a signal anchor after membrane translocation. The spr, yebA, and ydhO genes have been renamed as mepS, mepM, and mepH, respectively (M. Reddy, personal communication).	87081989	P0AFS9	b1856	6189	JW5304	Null

A mutation resulting in a tyrosine to tryptophan substitution at position 106 results in a hyperactive phenotype, while a double mutation T87I/Y106W resulted in loss of activity. Substitutions at ILE95 affect FliM binding. CheY can be reversibly acetylated at lysine residues 91, 92, 109, 119, 122, and 126 by acetyl-CoA synthase (Acs) in vitro (Barak, 1992; Barak, 2004). CheY can autoacetylate lysines in its C-terminal region in vitro (Barak, 2006). A high level of lysine acetylation of CheY is detected in vivo, and both Acs-dependent, acetate-stimulated acetylation and Acs-independent acetylation occurs (Yan, 2008). In vivo Acs-dependent lysine acetylation of CheY is consistent with the chemotaxis defects observed in Acs mutants and CheY Lys92 mutants (Barak, 2001) Acs-independent acetylation of CheY could be due to autoacetylation or the activity of a second lysine acetyltransferase such as the lysine acetyltransferase Pka(YfiQ) that has been shown to acetylate Acs lysines in vivo in Salmonella. CobB can deacetylate CheY in vitro and in vivo, reducing FliM binding and chemotaxis (Li, 2010). cobB is a mutational phenotypic suppressor of a cheA cheZ double mutation (Li, 2010).

The dual translation initiation sites for ClpB have been confirmed using site-directed mutagenesis (Park, 1993).

MltD can be modified by lysine acetylation in vitro using purified E. coli Pka(YfiQ) (Thao, 2010). MltD has been shown to be a murein hydrolase using zymography, to cause lysis or osmotically-stabilized spheroplasts when overproduced, and to be inhibited by bulgecin (Dijkstra A.J., Rudd, K.E., and Keck, W., A new member of the transglycosylase family of Escherichia coli displays a Gram-positive hydrolase motif, in "The soluble lytic transglycolsylase family of Escherichia coli", A.J. Dijkstra, pp. 85-101, Ph.D. thesis, University of Groningen, the Netherlands, 1997). MltD has two Gram-positive peptidoglycan-binding motifs in the C-terminus. MltD has a central lysozyme-like domain. MltD should cleave the glycosidic bonds between the N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in murein. The first 15 aa of MltD are a type II signal peptide. The proposed DniR function as a regulator of hexaheme nitrite reductase is probably artifactual. A mutant lacking five murein hydrolases (amiABCmltCD=MHD90) has a delayed lysis phenotype after beta-lactam treatment (Heidrich, 2002).	; 1786405	P0AEZ7	b0211	704	JW5018	CG30876

FrdA was shown to be covalently modified with an FAD linked through the methyl group at position 8alpha to the N(3) of one of the FrdA histidine residues (Weiner, 1979). His45 was predicted to be the site of FrdA flavinylation with FAD by similarity to the sequenced histidine-modified bovine heart flavopeptide SHTVAAXGGIBLAAGBMDEBXWR (Kenney, 1972; Cole, 1982). Substitutions of FrdA at His45 still allow tight binding of FAD non-covalently but nonetheless still result in defective enzyme activities (Blaut, 1989). In vitro flavinylation of FrdA using crude extracts was stimulated by citrate, isocitrate, succinate and fumarate (Brandsch, 1989). The crystal structure shows that His45 of FrdA is covalently modified with FAD to form tele-8alpha-FAD histidine (Iverson, 1999). SdhE, the SdhA flavinylator, may also facilitate FrdA flavinylation (McNeil, 2013). The FrdA N-terminus is blocked so it could not be protein sequenced to verify the start; if the fMet is clipped then the Glu2 could form a blocking pyroglutamate, J. H. Weiner, personal communication cited in (Cole, 1982). frdA transcription is repressed by nitrate via the NarXL system.

Overproduced FtsW but not overproduced MurJ increases lipid II translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane in crude reconstituted vesicles (Mohammadi, 2011). Both FtsW and MurJ are involved in lipid II translocation but which one is the actual flippase is controversial with conflicting in vivo and in vitro results; the in vitro results utilize crude membrane vesicles that also contain MurJ, which may not be limiting; the in vivo results do not demonstrate flippase activity directly and FtsW inactivation could be incomplete, so one of the two proteins could be stimulating the other which has the flippase activity; MurJ is related to known flippase exporters and FtsW is not, suggesting that MurJ may indeed be the actual flippase (Young, 2014).

The activity and allosteric regulation of IlvA have been studied using purified enzymes in vitro (Grimminger, 1973; Calhoun, 1973; Koerner, 1975; Eisenstein, 1991; Eisenstein, 1994; Eisenstein, 1995; Chen, 2013). The Salmonella RidA(YjgF) is an enamine and imine deaminase required for the removal of the two unstable, toxic, tautomeric reactive intermediates, aminocrotonate and iminobutyrate, which are produced during the IlvA-mediated, PLP-dependent threonine dehydratase reaction; producing 2-ketobutyrate and releasing ammonia in a hydrolysis reaction that may require catalysis, due either to the low water environment or immediate toxicity in the cell; IlvA also dehydrates serine to yield pyruvate via analogous enamine/imine intermediates, also removed by RidA (Lambrecht, 2012). The N-terminal sequence of cloned and overproduced IlvA shows that the fMet is clipped, but the natural ilvA RBS was not used so it is not Verified, but the ATG start is reliable based on comparisons to Salmonella; 95% of the purified enzyme had its N-terminus blocked (Eisenstein, 1991).

Since high K+ concentrations lower phosphoryated KdpE, it was suggested that high intracellular potassium downregulates the KdpD autophosphoryation activity, resulting in less phosphotransferance to KdpE (Heermann, 2009; Lüttmann, 2009). A salt shock increases ATP concentrations and probably stimulates KdpD phosphatase activity since a deletion of the ATP-binding site of KdpD deregulates its phosphatase activity (Ohwada, 1987; Jung, 1998).	; 1786911	P21866	b0694	2366	JW5096	CG31571

Lit-mediated T4 phage exclusion depends upon translation of the gol (growth on lit) region of the T4 capsid gene 23 to make a polypeptide segment that binds to EF-Tu and enables EF-Tu proteolysis by Lit between residues Gly60 and Ile61, causing global inhibition of translation and cell death prior to the translation of late genes and production of T4 virions, blocking viral transmission (Bergsland, 1990; Yu, 1994; Georgiou, 1998; Bingham, 2000; Copeland, 2004). Overproduced Lit protein is enriched in mini-cell inner membrane fractions (Kao, 1998). The mode of Lit protein inner membrane binding is uncertain because the prediction of transmembrane domains for Lit is ambiguous as zero, one and two transmembrane domains have been variously predicted, but generally most programs do not predict any transmembrane domains.

The LpoB-PBP1B complex may contribute to OM constriction during cell division (Typas, 2010). MrcB is part of a complex with MltA and MipA. The N-terminal transglycosylase activity polymerizes the glycan backbone and is penicillin-insensitive. The C-terminal transpeptidase activity crosslinks the muramic peptides and is penicillin-sensitive. Full length MrcB is the alpha isoform. A second in vivo ATG start at codon 46 produces the 799 aa gamma isoform. Murein polymerase is an essential function satisfied by either MrcA or MrcB. Mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006).

E. coli Nth was re-discovered as a urea-DNA glycosylase (Breimer, 1980). Purified Nth has a DNA N-glycoslylase activity that creates apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) sites at certain DNA lesions that are then cleaved by AP lyase, a second Nth activity (Gates, 1977; Demple, 1980; Katcher, 1983; Breimer, 1984; Bailly, 1987; Kow, 1987; Kim, 1988). The AP lyase activity of Nth cleaves DNA by a beta elimination rather than a hydrolase mechanism, leading to the suggestion that Nth not be considered as an endonuclease; this notion was subsequently disputed by another group, and later reasserted (Bailly, 1987; Kim, 1988; Bailly, 1989).

PNPase activity is modulated by citrate binding (Nurmohamed, 2011). PNPase activity is modulated by c-di-GMP and PNPase is in a degradosome complexed with DosCP (Tuckerman, 2011). Cold induction occurs by reversal of post-translational autoregulation. The pnp mRNA leader is cleaved by RNase III, allowing PNPase to repress its own translation. Mutation of Gly454 impairs autogenous regulation without affecting catalytic activity. Mutants have elevated OM vesiculation (McBroom, 2006). Pnp can add long polynucleotide tails to mRNAs terminated by Rho factor (Mohanty, 2006). The overexpression of the Pnp S1 domain suppresses the cold growth defect of quadruple cspABEG mutant strain BX04 (Xia, 2001). 3/836 peptide masses from MS analysis indicate that an upstream start codon is utilized, but this contradicts N-terminal sequencing data and the upstream sequences are not conserved (Maillet, 2007). In Salmonella, a pnp mutant shows decreased expresssion of csgD, csgA and increased expression of yjcC; an nlpI mutant shows the opposite response as a pnp mutant (Rouf, 2011).	; 1789555	P05055	b3164	10397	JW5851	CG379

The ribosome changes reading frame after codon 25 of the frameshifted prfB gene, an example of programmed frameshifting. The very poor growth of rluD deletion mutants in E. coli K-12 can be suppressed by a point mutation in prfB and a role in translation termination for the 23S rRNA helix 69 pseudouridines has been demonstrated (Ejby, 2007). The very poor growth of rluD deletions in all E. coli K-12 strains is due to their having a defective prfB gene with Thr246 instead of the Ala246 or Ser246 found in all other E. coli and Salmonella strains; rluD deletions have little effect on growth or stop codon recognition in a prfB Ala246 background (Uno, 1996; Dinçbas-Renqvist, 2000; Heurgué-Hamard, 2002; Dreyfus, 2011; O'Connor, 2011; Schaub, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD mutants in E. coli K-12 is due to increased translational readthrough and can be suppressed by point mutations in prfB or prfC (O'Connor, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD prfB mutants in E. coli K-12 is largely due to rpsG translation readthrough (and polar effects) and can be suppressed by restoring the rpsG stop codon, which is mutated to a Leu codon in K-12, leading to a 23 aa extension of ribosomal protein S7 (Dreyfus, 2011; Schaub, 2011). prfB is essential (Kawakami, 1988). The prfB mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of prfB in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009).	; 367172	P07012	b2891	9488	JW5847	CG17635

RecA protein was initially observed as Protein X, a membrane protein induced after inhibition of cell division and DNA synthesis (Inouye, 1970). Protein X has been demonstrated to be the product of the recA gene (McEntee, 1977; Gudas, 1977; Emmerson, 1977; Little, 1977). Protein X (RecA) is transcriptionally induced by the inhibition of DNA synthesis to comprise 4% of total cell protein, 10% of which is membrane-bound (Gudas, 1976). RecA is an ATP-dependent dsDNA binding protein and is an ATP-independent, SSB-stimulated ssDNA binding protein, however the ssDNA-RecA complex is stabilized by NTPs (Gudas, 1976; McEntee, 1979; McEntee, 1981). The RecA C-terminal dsDNA binding domain contacts dsDNA at conserved residues W290, I298, G301 and K302 (Aihara, 1997). The dsDNA binding site of RecA also binds the displaced ssDNA strand (Mazin, 1998). RecA R244Q and K246N mutants are proficient in ssDNA binding but are defective in dsDNA binding (Kurumizaka, 1999). RecA does not bind to DNA with extensive cruciform structures, except in the presence of SSB. RecA-dependent autocleavage of the LexA repressor also requires ATP and DNA and signals the SOS response to DNA damage by inducing the LexA regulon. RecA-dependent autocleavage of UmuD is required for polV (UmuD'C) lesion bypass. RecA filamentation is inhibited by RecX. RecA-dependent autocleavage of phage repressors mediates prophage induction after exposure to DNA damaging agents such as UV irradiation.

The modifed ribonucleotide 5-methyluridine, referred to as ribothymidylic acid, was found to be universally present in bulk E. coli tRNA (Zamir, 1965). The position of ribothymidine at position 54 was established when the first E. coli tRNA was sequenced (Goodman, 1968). Ribothymidine was shown to be uridine modified by a methyltransferase using tritiated methionine as the in vivo methyl donor for labeling 5-methyluridine in E. coli tyrosyl tRNA (Goodman, 1970). The trmA mutation was identified, named, mapped and predicted to be the structural gene for tRNA m(5)U methyltransferase (Björk, 1970; Björk, 1975). The trmA gene was cloned and restriction mapped (Ny, 1980). The tRNA m(5)U54 modification is found in all sequenced E. coli tRNAs (Sprinzl, 1985; Sprinzl, 1987). The TrmA enzyme was first purified based upon its tRNA m(5)U54 methyltransferase activity (Greenberg, 1980). TrmA with a high tRNA m(5)U54 methyltransferase specific actvity was purified, characterized, N-terminally sequenced and found to co-purify with a heterogenous RNA fraction (Ny, 1988). The trmA gene and promoter region were sequenced and trmA gene expression was shown to be growth rate regulated at the level of transcription (Gustafsson, 1991). The m(5)U341 modification in tmRNA was identified and TrmA was predicted to be the responsible tmRNA modification enzyme because m(5)U341 is the tmRNA base corresponding to m(5)U54 in tRNAs (Feldon, 1998). A trmA mutant lacks the m(5)U341 modification in tmRNA (Ranaei-Siadat, 2013).	; 1790403	P23003	b3965	12983	JW3937	CG79

The only amino acid difference between TufA and TufB is the last amino acid, G394 in TufA and S394 in TufB. EF-Tu lysines K38, K177, K249, K253, K295 and K314 can be modified to N6-succinyllysine (Zhang, 2011). EF-Tu lysines K177, K188, K209 and K314 can be modified to N6-acetyllysine (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2009). HipA binds and was reported to phosphorylate EF-Tu residue Thr-383 in vitro (Schumacher, 2009). HipA is not EF-Tu kinase (Germain, 2013). The phage P1 toxin Doc phosphorylates EF-Tu in vitro at Thr383, blocking its ability to bind aminoacylated tRNAs (Castro-Roa, 2013). EF-Tu can be modified at K57 to either N6-monomethyllysine or N6,N6-dimethyllysine; the methyltransferases responsible for these modifications are unknown (L'Italien, 1979; G.F.-L. Ames, 1979). Methylation of EF-Tu at K57 impedes GTP hydrolysis in vitro (Van Noort, 1986). Nutrient starvation promotes the conversion of N6-monomethyllysine to N6,N6-dimethyllysine at K57 in E. coli B EF-Tu (Young, 1990; Young, 1991). tufA encodes an essential function, with duplicate gene tufB, such that tufA or tufB can be deleted, but the double mutant is inviable. Coliphage Q beta replicase is comprised of the phage-encoded beta subunit and three bacterial proteins: TufB, Tsf and RpsA (Kondo, 1970; Kamen, 1970; Blumenthal, 1972; Wahba, 1974). RpsA is dispensible for RNA synthesis by coliphage Q beta replicase and is not part of the core replicase (Kamen, 1972; Hori, 1974; Landers, 1974). 50-80% of EF-Tu can be located at the cytoplasmic membrane, possibly as a result of nutrient stress, and EF-Tu may have a ribosome-independent role since it is present in at least a four-fold molar excess over ribosomes; methylation status of K57 may be related to membrane localization (Jacobson, 1976; Young, 1991). Various mutants and growth conditions have demonstrated that EF-Tu, or a precursor form pTu, can be localized to the outer membrane (Dombou, 1981; Lifson, 1986; Sedgwick, 1986). EF-Tu can form filamentous structures in vitro and has been suggested to be an actin-like cytoskeletal protein (Minkoff, 1975; Minkoff, 1976; Rosenbusch, 1976; Jacobson, 1976; Minkoff, 1977; Beck, 1978; Wurtz, 1978; Beck, 1979; Cremers, 1981; Schilstra, 1986; Helms, 1995; Helms, 1996; Norris, 2007). Although early results indicated a lack of an in vivo EF-Tu cytoskeletal structure in E. coli, subsequent experiments identified a helically organized EF-Tu-containing intracellular protofilament near the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane with polysomes attached; it was suggested that an EF-Tu-containing cytoskeletal web might be the original prokaryotic cytoskeleton and that MreB evolved later to build upon the EF-Tu cytoplasmic network and be a cell shape determinant (Schilstra, 1984; Mayer, 2003; Mayer, 2006). In B. subtilis, EF-Tu is found in a static helical structure at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane co-localized with MreB; MreB and EF-Tu interact in vivo and in vitro; reduction of intracellular EF-Tu affects cell shape but not translation efficiency; EF-Tu intracellular protofilaments may serve as tracks for dynamic MreB shape-determining filaments (Defeu, 2010).

UmuC has weak DNA polymerase activity that is greatly stimulated by UmuD' and RecA (Reuven, 1999). Uncleaved UmuD(2)C is a DNA damage checkpoint effector that can delay replication restart until it is converted into Pol V (Opperman, 1999; Murli, 2000; Ferentz, 2001). Pol V has intrinsic AP lyase activity (Chen, 2005). Pol V is a RecA-ssDNA binding protein (Frank, 1993). The RecA-ssDNA complex, a nucleoprotein filament, is required for PolV translesion bypass synthesis (Reuven, 2001). The active form of PolV is UmuD'(2)C-RecA-ATP (Jiang, 2009). Because Pol V (UmuD'(2)C) is mutagenic it is regulated by UmuD autocleavage activation to UmuD' and by Lon and ClpXP-mediated regulated degradation of UmuC, UmuD, and UmuD'; UmuD' is targeted for ClpXP-mediated degradation by the UmuD protein in the UmuDD' dimer, leaving UmuD intact; UmuD and UmuC are degraded by Lon (Frank, 1996; Gonzalez, 1998; Gonzalez, 2000).

Uncleaved UmuD(2)C is a DNA damage checkpoint effector that can delay replication restart until it is converted into Pol V (Opperman, 1999; Murli, 2000; Ferentz, 2001). Pol V has intrinsic AP lyase activity (Chen, 2005). Trans-autocleavage of an UmuD homodimer subunit by the other UmuD subunit, triggered by the UmuD dimer binding to a ssDNA-RecA complex, removes the first 24 amino acids to form UmuD' which is required for mutageneic translesion synthesis (TLS) (Shinagawa, 1988; Nohmi, 1988; Burckhardt, 1988; Shiba, 1990; Woodgate, 1991; Bailone, 1991; Lee, 1996; McDonald, 1998; Opperman, 1999; Sutton, 2001). UmuD and UmuD' are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that can nonetheless form stable dimers (Simon, 2008). Pol V is a RecA-ssDNA binding protein (Frank, 1993). The RecA-ssDNA complex, a nucleoprotein filament, is required for PolV translesion bypass synthesis (Reuven, 2001). The active form of PolV is UmuD'(2)C-RecA-ATP (Jiang, 2009).

At least four groups have deleted rsmH(mraW,yabC): Carrion(1999) found it to be essential for growth; Arigoni(1998) found a reduced growth rate; Dassain(1999) and Merlin(2002) found that the deletion strain grew normally. A possible explanation is that the Carrion et al. mutation might be polar on a downstream essential gene. But this defect would have to be suppressible by RsmH(MraW) overexpression. Carrion(1999) found some protein starting with the second Met which might represent an alternative initiation site. Limiting MAP, when RsmH(MraW) is overproduced, is probably not the explanation since MM- is not a MAP substrate.	; 1786270	P60390	b0082	304	JW0080	CG82531

TsaBCDE are necessary and sufficient for tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification in vitro (Deutsch, 2012). TsaD(YgjD) was proposed to be a threonine-bicarbonate ligase producing N-carbamoylthreonine which was proposed to then be transferred to the N(6) group of tRNA(NNU) A37 by TsaC(YrdC); TsaB(YeaZ) is required for the essential function of TsaD(YjgD) (El Yacoubi, 2011). Depletion of TsaD(YgjD) prevents tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification (Srinivasan, 2010). tsaD(ygjD) mutants accumulate toxic glycated proteins (Amadori-modified proteins); the accumulation of glycated FtsZ in TsaD(YgjD)-depleted cells may explain the genome maintenance phenotype and the unusual cell shapes of tsaD(ygjD) mutants (Katz, 2010). S. cerevisiae Qri7, involved in genome maintenance, complements a tsaD(ygjD) mutant growth defect in E. coli (Oberto, 2009). Loss of TsaD(YgjD) in E. coli causes small cell size and nucleoid loss (Obero, 2009). Depletion of TsaD(YgjD) causes a proportion of cells to be enlarged, with a peripheral distribution of DNA; the TsaD(YgjD) depletion phenotype is suppressed by multicopy clones of rstA (Handford, 2009). TsaD(YgjD) family proteins have been termed UGMPs (Universal Genome Maintenance Proteins) but this may be a pleiotropic phenotype primarily due to a defect in tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 modification (Oberto, 2009). (TsaB)YeaZ interacts with TsaE(YjeE) and TsaD(YgjD), preferring TsaD(YgjD); TsB(YeaZ) can proteolyze TsaD(YgjD) in vitro (Handford, 2009). TsaD(YgjD) is a homolog of a reported glycoprotease named Gcp, but TsaD(YgjD) does not have glycoprotease activity against glycophorin A and multicopy Gcp (M.h.) expression does not complement an E. coli TsaD(YgjD) deficiency, indicating that M. hemolytica Gcp and E. coli YgjD are not isofunctional orthologs; Gcp (M.h.) may not partner properly with the E. coli TsaB(YeaZ) protein (Handford, 2009). The identification of M. hemolytica Gcp as a glycoprotease was probably incorrect (Srinivasan, 2010). Since TsaD(YgjD) does not have glycoprotese activity and the homologous M. hemolytica Gcp is also probably not a glycoprotease, gcp was retired as the primary gene name for tsaD(ygjD). The tsaD-rpsUdnaGrpoD divergent operon promoter region binds ArcA (Federowicz, 2014).	1789445	P05852	b3064	10058	JW3036	Null

EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) are required to modify EF-P Lys34 by lysylation of the epsilon amino group; failure to modify EF-P with lysine results in a slow growth defect; EpmB(YjeK) may convert alpha-lysyl-EF-P to beta-lysyl-EF-P (Yanagisawa, 2010). A third and final EF-P post-translation modification enzyme EpmC(YfcM) is identified as EF-P-Lys34 hydroxylase; EpmC(YfcM) acts after beta-lysinylation of Lys34 by EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK); EpmC(YfcM) adds an oxygen atom to the C5 position of Lys34 and does not modify the added beta-lysine; YjeA and YjeK were renamed as EpmA and EpmB, respectively (Peil, 2012). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) were predicted to be responsible for the modification of EF-P Lys34 with spermidine, but Lys34 is actually modified with another lysine, not spermidine; epmB(yjeK) is in the efp genetic neighborhood in many strains and all genomes that have the conserved Lys34 in EF-P have epmB(yjeK) orthologs; EpmB(YjeK) is a lysine 2,3-aminomutase homolog (but in a different clade) (Bailly, 2010; Yanagisawa, 2010). The epmA(yjeA) pleiotropic phenotypes are not due to a defect in pyruvate oxidase and the apparent regulation of poxB may be a minor role for EpmA(YjeA).

The original yjjB sequence had a C-terminal frameshift extending YjjB, but homology analysis suggests that the extension is artifactual. No YjjB protein was expressed in minicells, but a LacZ fusion indicates this gene is expressed. Homology extends upstream to end of yjjP gene, but the predicted MW is a little higher than observed. A GTG alternate start at codon 3 has a better apparent RBS and would be coupled with the motif GTGA to the upstream gene stop codon.

Four ribonucleases, Rnc, Rnr, Pnp and Rph, redundantly process 16S rRNA, and although this does not rule out a role for YbeY as co-ribonuclease with Rnr, the role of YbeY as being the nuclease activity responsible for the removal of the 33 nucleotides at the 3' end of 16S rRNA has been questioned (Sulthana, 2013). RNase R (Rnr) is de-stabilized by proteolysis in exponential phase relative to stationary phase due to Pka-mediated acetylation of Rnr Lys544 in exponential phase only; lysine-acetylated Rnr binds tmRNA-SmpB tightly for exponential phase Rnr protein degradation (Liang, 2010; Liang, 2011). Rnr is specifically required for SsrA-SmpB-dependent decay of non-stop aberrant mRNAs (Richards, 2006). The N-terminal cold shock domains are required for an intrinsic Rnr RNA unwinding (helicase) activity (Awano, 2009). The cold shock domains are dispensible for Rnr RNase activity on structured RNAs (Vincent, 2009). rnr is transiently induced after a cold shock. rnr is orthologous with Shigella virulence gene vacB. 	; 87082383	P21499	b4179	13678	JW5741	CG34417

GspB has a single predicted N-terminal transmembrane segment (28-50), followed by a predicted periplasmic domain, which may interact with GspA. GspA may interact with GspB. A divergon is a regulon comprised of two adjacent divergent operons or genes. gspB was initially identified as an ORF that might be the 11.3 kDa PinO protein synthesized in the absence of isoleucine in relA stains (Guzman, 1991). But GspB is predicted to be 15.9 kDa and has isoleucine residues and there is no evidence that gspB encodes the PinO peptide or that it binds calcium. No homology to calmodulin or other calcium-binding proteins is predicted. gspB may have been mistaken for pinO due to use of a downstream ATG as start codon, but the 11 kD C-terminal fragment does have an Ile reside in it, making gspB inconsistent with pinO. pioO was the prior gene name assigned to pinO since the gene name pin was already taken.	; 1789719	P03825	b3322	10865	JW3284	CG53557

The original interpretation of the mak-up mutation as being in the mak coding region has been clarified by identifying the GTG initiation codon at the previous codon 47, placing the mak-up mutation in the putative promoter region. The unpublished protein sequencing is noted in Miller (2005) and the actual protein sequence data obtained (MRIGIDLGGTKTEVIALGDAGEQLY) was provided as a personal communication from Brian Miller (March, 2006).	; 87081733	P23917	b0394	1372	JW0385	CG75869

The acuI gene of R. sphaeroides has been shown to be an acryloyl-CoA reductase yielding propionyl-CoA (Schneider, 2012).

MeaB and Mcm are fused in some organisms. MeaB of M. extorquens binds and hydrolyzes GTP. ArgK is a homolog of the human disease gene MMAA, implicated in methylmalonic aciduria. argK is part of a four gene operon encoding enzymes converting succinate to propionate.

CsrA translationally represses the GGDEF diguanylate cyclase enzymes DgcZ(YdeH) and YcdT, which are needed for normal motility (Jonas, 2008). Recombinant CsrA-His6 was N-terminally sequenced, but this does not Verify since translation start was forced at ATG: Met is not clipped: MLIL start. CsrA also postively regulates FlhCD post-translationally, and hence is required for motility. CsrA exerts reciprocal effects on glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis and glycogen biosynthesis. glgC mRNA-binding activity blocks GlgC translation.	; 1789047	P69913	b2696	8866	JW2666	CG34504

MliC is membrane-bound, consistent with the prediction that it is a lipoprotein (Callewaert, 2008). mliC is in the Rcs regulon (Callewaert, 2009). A mliC(ydhA) mutant has no obvious phenotype, and mliC(ydhA) mRNA was not detected (Lam, 1992). The first 17 aa of MliC are predicted to be a type II signal peptide. The solution structure of an 82 aa C-terminal fragment (with a 20 aa N-tag added) was determined, and a disulfide bond between C37 and C102 was observed (precursor numbering) (Revington, 2006). The unlikely, originally annotated, start site at M28 was misinterpreted as the start of a mature MliC(YdhA) protein (Revington, 2006). The predicted lipoprotein nature of MliC has not been experimentally confirmed. SignalP predicts a possible type I signal cleavage after residue 22, but the LipoP prediction for a lipoprotein is much better.	87081949	P28224	b1639	5485	JW1631	Null

Published transduction mapping results were used to locate the tsaA1 mutation to yaeB, which encodes the only predicted methyltransferase near tsaA1 (K. Rudd, 2011, unpublished). The crystal structure of the TsaA(YaeB) ortholog AF0241 from A. fulgidus has a bound SAM molecule leading to the prediction that TsaA(YaeB) is a novel methyltransferase (Forouhar, 2007). The crystal structure of the TsaA(YaeB) ortholog RPA0152 from R. palustris has a bound SAM molecule (Chang, C., Evdokimova, E., Liu, F., Savchenko, A., Edwards, A., Joachimiak, A., unpublished). Threonine tRNA(GGU) 1 (ThrV) modified to t(6)A37 (ThrV) is also methylated to form m(6)t(6)A37 (Komine, 1992). Threonine tRNA(GGU) 3 (ThrT) modified to t(6)A37 is also methylated to form m(6)t(6)A37 (Clarke, 1974). TsaA(YaeB) is a member of the UPF0066 family. otherPDB(R.palustris): 3OKX. otherPDB(A.fulgidus): 2NV4.

Terminal C and CC bases block ssRNA and ssDNA cleavage in vitro (Zuo, 2002). In vitro Rnt is an exonuclease for ssDNA with a higher affinity for DNA than RNA and the degradation of ssDNA by Rnt is tenfold more efficient than RNA degradation (Viswanathan, 1998; Zuo, 1999; Hsiao, 2012). Overproduction of Rnt suppresses the UV sensitivity of recJ, xseAB and sbcB mutants (Viswanathan, 1999). Mutant rnt cells are sensivitive to a variety of DNA damaging agents, including UV irradiation which conflicts with an earlier report (Padmanabha, 1991; Hsiao, 2014). Rnt digests Y-structured, bubble, and bulge DNA and works with Nfi(Endonuclease V) in DNA repair; Rnt can digest dsDNA and go through C and CC bases when digesting bulge and bubble DNA (Hsiao, 2014). 4/16 Rnt peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).	; 1787941	P30014	b1652	5523	JW1644	CG32271

In vitro, overexpressed E. coli ThiC increases phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase activity although a cell extract is also required, probably to reduce the 4Fe-4S cluster (Lawhorn, 2004). E. coli ThiC contains a 4Fe-4S cluster that requires either IscA or SufA for proper assembly (Tan, 2009). In vitro, purified Salmonella thiC-encoded phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase produces HMP (4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine) from AIR (5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole) utilizing SAM and a labile 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster in a reaction reminiscent of Radical SAM family reactions although ThiC does not contain the Radical SAM Cys signature motif (Martinez-Gomez, 2008). An apbE mutant of Salmonella typhimurium is blocked for thiamine biosynthesis at the ThiC step (conversion of AIR to HMP) (Beck, 1998; Beck, 1999). HMP is also known as 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine and AIR is also known as 5-aminoimidazole ribotide. thiCEFSGH operon expression is controlled by a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) responsive riboswitch in the 5' UTR. The thiC riboswitch is the target for the antibiotic pyrithiamine. The transcription start point (tsp) of the thiCEFSGH operon has not been mapped.	; 1790427	P30136	b3994	13057	JW3958	CG115

In E. coli B, para-cresol is probably converted to 4-hydroxy-benzoyl alcohol in vivo by an oxidase that is missing from K strains (Kriek, 2007), and thus 4-hydroxy-benzoyl alcohol is probably not the primary tyrosine cleavage product as previously suggested (White, 1979). 	; 1790423	P30140	b3990	13048	JW3953	CG34292

Full induction of pgaD requires c-di-GMP specifically produced by DgcZ(YdeH) (Boehm, 2009). DgcZ(YdeH) mRNA is translationally repressed by CsrA (Jonas, 2008). DgcZ(YdeH) overexpression causes a 20-fold increase in c-di-GMP and represses motility, but a dgcZ(ydeH) mutant has little effect (Jonas, 2008). The results of Jonas (2008) might indicate that although the c-di-GMP spike inhibits motility it is not known if this is the normal function of the overproduced diguanylate cyclase or if the overexpression induced non-physiological crosstalk. DgcZ(YdeH) has an N-terminal MCP-signal associated domain (PF13682) that is often C-terminal to an MCP-signal domain (PF00015) not found in DgcZ(YdeH) family proteins but may be indicative of a physiological role in chemotaxis or motility; DgcZ(YdeH) has a C-terminal diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain.	1787816	P31129	b1535	5123	JW1528	Null

YebF Cys35 has been shown to be fully oxidized in vivo, probably because it forms a disulphide bond with Cys108 (Leichert, 2008). YebF Cys35 is fully oxidized in vivo and Cys108 is 85% oxidized in vivo; Cys35-Cys108 of YebF form a DsbA-dependent disulphide bond (Vertommen, 2008). It is not known if YebF confers colicin immunity. YebF is secreted into the periplasm then exported into the medium across the OM in a porin-dependent manner; OmpF, OmpC, and OmpX are involved in YebF export; YebF interacts with OmpF and OmpC at their periplasmic face; the YebF NMR structure is similar to Cmi and is stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys35 and Cys108 (Prehna, 2012). C-terminal fusions with YebG are exported, which is useful for exporting fusion proteins (Zhang, 2006; Fisher, 2011; Chen, 2012).

The E. coli YceI crystal structure includes a bound 2-octaprenylphenol molecule in a lipocalin-like fold (PDB: 1Y0G). Two yceI family members from B. cenocepacia, BCAL3310 and BCAL3311, encode secreted proteins that bind to polymixin B and confer resistance and heteroresistance (El-Halfawy, 2013). A crystal structure of the T. thermophilus YceI family member TT1927b has a bound polyprenyl pyrophosphate molecule; structure comparisons indicate that although structurally similar to OmpA YceI family proteins are not outer membrane proteins but are soluble proteins with hydrophobic cores binding lipid molecules (Handa, 2005). A crystal structure of the H. pylori YceI family member HP1286, which is low pH-inducible and secreted out to the medium, has a bound polyprenyl pyrophosphate molecule (Sisinni, 2010). The P. syringae PSPPH_4050-encoded YceI-like protein crystal structure includes a bound ubiquinone-8 molecule (PDB: 3Q34). The predicted presence of an antiparallel beta-barrel in YceI has led to its mischaracterization as an outer membrane protein (Yan, 2014).	1787295	P0A8X2	b1056	3583	JW1043	Null

One of the redundant function proteins YqjA or YghB is required for general envelope maintenance and for PMF homeostasis under various growth conditions (Sikdar, 2012). A yqjA yghB double mutant has a membrane defect causing a cell division defect at low temperatures and an osmoremedial growth defect at elevated temperatures (Thomkins, 2008). DedA superfamily proteins YqjA and YghB likely have redundant functions since only a double mutant has defects; DedA superfamily members yabI or yohD can complement the yqjA yghB double mutant when overproduced, but a dedA clone cannot complement (Thompkins, 2008). Induced by AI-2 pheromone. A yqjA yghB double mutant is defective in the Tat-dependent export of AmiA and AmiC (Sikdar, 2009). A yqjA yghB double mutant is complemented by the sole dedA family gene in B. burgdorferi bb0250 (Liang, 2010). The E. coli K-12 DedA superfamily (SNARE associated Golgi protein/PF09335) has eight paralogs in two families, the COG0586 DedA/YghB family (including the DedA/YabI/YohD subfamily and the general envelope maintenance protein YghB/YqjA subfamily) and the YdjX family (including the COG0398 YdjX/YdjZ subfamily and the COG1238 YqaA subfamily) (Doerrler, 2013; K.E.R.).

Etp Y121 is shown to be phosphorylated by an unknown kinase, not Etk or Wzc (Nadler, 2012). The Etk paralog Wzc is autophosphorylated intra-molecularly at Y569 and inter-molecularly at Y708, Y710, Y711, Y713 and Y715, as experimentally demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro kinase assays; all six phosphorylated Wzc tyrosines are conserved in Etk (Y574, Y713, Y715, Y717, Y718 and Y720 (Grangeasse, 2002). A crystal structure of Etk did not show tyrosine phosphates due to rapid dephosphorylation during the sample preparation; structure-guided mutagenesis with enzymatic and phenotypic characterization of the K-12 Etk kinase supports a proposed Y574-R614 interaction and molecular switching mechanism (Lee, 2008). Experimental evidence and molecular dynamics simulations support the molecular switch interaction between Y574 and R614 and also identifies R572 as influencing the rotation of P-Y574 (Lu, 2009). Like its paralog Wzc, Etk is a membrane-bound protein with two transmembrane segments flanking a short N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a large periplasmic domain, and a large C-terminal catalytic cytoplasmic domain (Doublet, 2002; Daley, 2005). The O-antigen capsule is also known as the group 4 capsule (G4C).	1787216	P38134	b0981	3309	JW0964	Null

The SrkA(YihE) protein kinase may be involved in the regulation of the extracytoplasmic stress response in E. coli (Zheng, 2007). SrkA(YihE) was identified as a weakly expressed 39 kDa cytoplasmic protein in E. coli (Belin, 1994). The srkA(yihE) gene is involved in virulence of Shigella flexneri via its regulatory role of the gal operon during LPS synthesis; mutations in srkA(yihE) result in altered LPS structure (Edwards-Jones, 2004). SrkA(RdoA) is involved in relaying cpx-induced signals in Salmonella, where it was named rdoA (Suntharalingam, 2003). srkA(yihE) is in an operon with dsbA in E. coli, but not directly involved in disulfide bond formation (Belin, 1994). A transcript array in Shigella shows major changes in an srkA(yihE) deletion strain (Li, 2001). Mutations in srkA have a hyperlethality phenotype when cells are stressed; SrkA is a protein that reduces the lethal effects of stress (Han, 2010).

YihS has weak D-mannose isomerase in vitro (Itoh, 2008). YihS may be the weak D-mannose isomerase associated with D-lyxose isomerase activity, involved in lyxose catabolism, previously mapped as manC, and purified, however the oligomeric forms and amino acid compositions differ (Stevens, 1976; Stevens, 1981). Overproduction of YihS from the ASKA clone allows for growth on D-lyxose as the sole carbon source (Notebaart, 2014). The YihS(SquS) protein was overproduced using a pET vector to force translation initiation; although the protein sequence does not verify the start site, the start site prediction is very reliable and the protein sequencing confirms a prediction that the initial methionine is not clipped off (Itoh, 2008).	87082342	P32140	b3880	12673	JW5569	Null

Although it is not certain that a TS revertant of the streptomycin-dependent phenotype of a gltE mutant is also in the gltE gene, transductional mapping of a gltE revertant TS phenotype is consistent with, and more precise, than the 5% xylE linkage; however the observed 63% linkage of pyrE and gltE is at odds with a 25% linkage predicted for the 34 kb pyrE-trmL interval (Lapointe, 1975; K.E.R., 2013).

E. coli K-12 has other known and putative dicarboxylate transporters such as DcuAB, CitT and YbhI that were not tested for suppression of the Suc- phenotype, and DctR was not shown to be a dctA repressor, so DctR could be repressing a dicarboxylate transporter gene other than dctA. dctR and slp are in the AFI 12 gene acid fitness island and their roles in acids resistance are to counter the effects of organic acids in spent medium; a slp-dctR(yhiF) double mutant, but not either single mutant, loses protection against metabolites that are toxic at pH 2.5 including formate, succinate, and lactate, but not acetate; the double mutant phenotype can be complemented by a yhiF clone but complementation by a slp clone was not tested; this implies that Slp and DctR provide redundant protection; the protective role for DctR during the acid resistance response may be repression of one or more C4-dicarboxylate importers; a dctA mutant did not alter the slp-dctR phenotype, indicating that other C4-dicarboxylate importers in addition to or instead of DctA may be repressed by DctR (Mates, 2007). Overexpression of DctR causes filamentous biofilm formation (Tenorio, 2003). DctR is possibly involved in the regulation of type III secretion systems in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (Tatsuno, 2003). dctR is part of the EvgAS regulon (Masuda, 2002). Greater than 92% of the upstream slp mRNA is monocistronic and it is not known if all dctR expression is based on readthrough of the slp terminator or if dctR also has its own promoter (Alexander, 1994; Tucker, 2003).	1789923	P37195	b3507	11454	JW3475	Null

It is unlikely that the outer membrane lipoprotein Slp and the LuxR family putative transcriptional regulator DctR perform redundant molecular functions; one possible explanation for the apparent redundant protection against acid stress is that Slp is required for C4-dicarboxylate export and that either active export (Slp+) or represssed import (DctR+) of acidifying organic acids is sufficient for protection against toxic metabolites during acid stress.   Cloned Slp has been shown to incorporate tritiated palmitate and mature Slp production is sensitive to globomycin, indicting Slp is a lipoprotein (Alexander, 1994). Greater than 92% of the slp mRNA is monocistronic and it is not known if all of the downstream dctR expression is based on readthrough of the slp terminator or if dctR also has its own promoter (Alexander, 1994; Tucker, 2003). slp is part of the EvgAS regulon (Masuda, 2002).

ApbE of Vibrio harveyi is a flavin transferase required for the covalent flavinylation of NqrC, an RsxG homolog, with FMN at position Thr229 (Bertsova, 2013). Vibrio cholerae RnfD (RsxD homolog) and RnfG (RsxG homolog) are covalently FMN flavinylated at residues Thr187 and Thr175, respectively (Backiel, 2008). Vibrio alginolyticus NqrC (RsxG homolog) and NqrB (RsxD homolog) are covalently FMN flavinylated at residues Thr223 and Thr235, respectively (Hayashi, 2001). ApbE of Salmonella typhimurium is required for the assembly or repair of 4Fe-4S clusters (Skovran, 2003). An apbE mutant of Salmonella typhimurium is blocked for thiamine biosynthesis at the ThiC step (conversion of AIR to HMP) and Salmonella ApbE is anchored to the inner membrane in a periplasmic location; the periplasmic location, but not the membrane anchor, is required for ApbE function (Beck, 1998; Beck, 1999).

The very poor growth of rluD deletions in all E. coli K-12 strains is due to their having a mutant prfB gene with Thr246 instead of the Ala246 or Ser246 found in all other E. coli and Salmonella strains; rluD deletions have little effect on growth or stop codon recognition in a prfB Ala246 background (Dreyfus, 2011; O'Connor, 2011; Schaub, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD mutants in E. coli K-12 is due to increased translational readthrough and can be suppressed by point mutations in prfB or prfC (O'Connor, 2011). The very poor growth of rluD prfB mutants in E. coli K-12 is largely due to rpsG translation readthrough (and polar effects) and can be suppressed by restoring the rpsG stop codon, which is mutated to a Leu codon n K-12, leading to a 23 aa extension of ribosomal protein S7 (Dreyfus, 2011; Schaub, 2011).	; 1788946	P33643	b2594	8532	JW2576	CG53497

EF-P is present at one copy per ten ribosomes (An, 1980). efp has been reported to be an essential gene (Aoki, 1997) and to be a non-essential gene (Baba, 2006). The S. typhi efp gene is non-essential (Langridge, 2009). EF-P is homologous to eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-5A (Kyrpides, 1998). The previously reported function of EF-P to stimulate initial peptide bond formation has been recently challenged and appears not to be a critical function of EF-P (Ganoza, 2000; Blaha, 2009; Bullwinkle, 2012). The crystal structure of EF-P from T. thermophilus (PDB:1UEB) shows that, like other translation factors, EF-P is a tRNA mimic (Hanawa-Suetsugu, 2004). The T. thermophilus crystal structure of EF-P bound to ribosomes (PDB:3HUW) shows that the tRNA-like EF-P does not bind to tRNA binding sites in the ribosome, but rather binds between the P-site and the E-site, although footprinting experiments had previously shown binding to the A-site (Aoki, 2008; Blaha, 2009). EF-P appears to assist in the proper positioning of the fMet-tRNA for the formation of the first peptide bond (Aoki, 2008; Blaha, 2009). An earlier report that EF-P Lys34 is modified with spermidine has been refuted; the Lys34 is modified with lysine (Aoki, 2008 ; Yanagisawa, 2010). A Lys reside in eucaryotic eIF5A homologous to EF-P Lys34 is modified with hypusine (Chen, 1997). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) are required to modify EF-P Lys34 by lysylation of the epsilon amino group; failure to modify EF-P with lysine results in a slow growth defect; EpmB(YjeK) may convert alpha-lysyl-EF-P to beta-lysyl-EF-P (Yanagisawa, 2010). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) were predicted to be responsible for the modification of EF-P-Lys34 with spermidine, but Lys34 is actually modified with another lysine, not spermidine; epmB(yjeK) is in the efp genetic neighborhood in many strains and all genomes that have the conserved Lys34 in EF-P have epmB(yjeK) orthologs; EpmB(YjeK) is a lysine 2,3-aminomutase homolog (but in a different clade) (Bailly, 2010; Yanagisawa, 2010). Binds TrxA (Kumar, 2004). A third and final EF-P post-translation modification enzyme EpmC(YfcM) is identified as EF-P-Lys34 hydroxylase; EpmC(YfcM) acts after beta-lysinylation of Lys34 by EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK); EpmC(YfcM) adds an oxygen atom to the C5 position of Lys34 and does not modify the added beta-lysine; YjeA and YjeK were renamed as EpmA and EpmB, respectively (Peil, 2012).	; 1790590	P0A6N4	b4147	13583	JW4107	CG34470

RssB and ArcA are both phosphorylated by the ArcA sensor histidine protein kinase as part of a three-component system (Mika, 2005). RssB-initiated protyolysis of RpoS does not require the RssB response regulator phosphorylation site (Peterson, 2004). A yliE rssB9(hnr) double null mutant has significantly increased lycopene production in 1X M9; the effect may be salt-suppressible as it is not seen in 2X M9 (Alper, 2008). RssB is not a transcriptional regulator and does not have a DNA-binding domain typical of most response regulators. RssB(SprE) is required to maintain the association of PcnB with the degradosome during stationary phase (Carabetta, 2010).	; 1787487	P0AEV1	b1235	4147	JW1223	CG37471

Plasmid-mediated mdtABC-iceT(mdtD) overexpression confers resistance to deoxycholate and novobiocin in an acrAB mutant background but the same resistances are observed with mdtABC overexpression, indicating that iceT(mdtD) does not confer multidrug resistance (Nishino, 2001; Nagakubo, 2002). Chromosomal mdtABC-iceT(mdtD) expression induced by plasmid-mediated BaeR overproduction increases resistance to deoxycholate and novobiocin in an acrAB mutant; mutations in mdtB and mdtC but not iceT(mdtD) abolish this BaeR-induced resistance phenotype (Baranova, 2002). Consistent with arabinose export, an iceT(mdtD) mutant has increased intracellular arabinose, but not xylose; other compounds were not tested (Koita, 2012).	1788392	P36554	b2077	6879	JW2062	Null

Although its natural substrate(s) is unknown, purified YtjC(GpmB) has phosphatase activity against the model substrates para-nitrophenyl phosphate and 6-phospho-benzisoxazole (Khersonsky, 2011). GpmB/PhoE/CobC family proteins (COG0406) are sometimes misannotated as predicted phosphoglycerate mutases instead of predicted phosphatases; B. subtilus PhoE (a broad-specificity phosphatase) and S. typhimurium CobC (ribazole-5'-phosphate phosphatase) are COG0406 members with known activities (O'Toole, 1994; Ridgen, 2001). YjtC(GpmB) is not a phosphoglycerate mutase. YtjC(GpmB) is a member of the histidine phosphatase superfamily, represented by the InterPro superfamily profile IPR013078 and CDD cl11399 (also called the dPGM superfamily) including phosphatases and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases as well as factor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases; the histidine phosphatase superfamily is characterized by a conserved histidine that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle (Fothergill-Gilmore, 1989; Fothergill-Gilmore, 1990; Jedrzejas, 2000; Johnsen, 2007; Rigden, 2008; Foster, 2010). His9 of YtjC is predicted to be the transient phosphohistidine by homology. C10/130 YtjC(GpmB) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007).	1790856	P0A7A2	b4395	14416	JW4358	Null

CspE is a cold shock protein homolog, but is constitutively expressed at 37C. CspE has transcription antitermination activity (Bae, 2000). CspE affects rpoS and uspA expression. CspE is a negative regulator of cspA transcription. A cspE-flc(crcB) double mutant confers camphor-hypersensitivity and exacerbates the phenotypes of topo IV and MukB mutants, indicating that CspE and Flc(CrcB) may have a (possibly redundant) role in maintaining condensed chromosomes, either direct or indirect, possibly through the regulation of other gene products (Sand, 2003). CspE dimers bind ssDNA containing six or more contiguous dT residues with high affinity; CspE dimers binding two distant chromosome regions possible explains a condensin role for cspE when overexpressed with pagP(crcA) and flc(crcB) to suppress mukB mutations and confer camphor resistance (Hu, 1996; Johnston, 2006). Multicopy expression of cspE alone confers 10-fold camphor-resistance, a cspE-flc(crcB) clone confers 100-fold resistance, and the cspE-pagP-crcB clone confers 1000-fold resistance (single flc(crcB) or pagP clones had no effect); it is not known if the pagP gene product is contributing or if the three gene clone just expresses more flc(crcB) and/or cspE (Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone increases plasmid DNA supercoiling and reduces DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutant phenotypes (Sand, 2003). The cspE gene was also identified as a "negative regulator of growth in the cold", named as gicA, and submitted to Genbank (L29054) (Ramanathan Y., Narayanarao A.V.S.S., Mathur M., Mahajan S.K., Thesis (1994), University of Bombay, India). otherPDB (S. typhimurium): 3I2Z.	; 1786841	P0A972	b0623	2142	JW0618	CG31528

A cspE-flc(crcB) double mutant confers camphor-sensitivity and exacerbates the phenotypes of topo IV and MukB mutants (Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone compensates for a loss of the normal condensin MukBEF and recondenses chromosomes decondensed by camphor treatment (Hu, 1996; Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone increases plasmid DNA supercoiling and reduces DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutant phenotypes (Sand, 2003). The phoP-activation phenotype was initially characterized in Salmonella then confirmed in E. coli (Jia, 2004).

Homodimeric monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4 binds FeS and can efficiently transfer FeS clusters to Fdx in vitro (Yeung, 2011). BolA can form a heterodimer in vitro with FeS-bound monothiol glutaredoxin Grx4 but this complex is much less efficient than the FeS-bound Grx4 homodimer in FeS cluster transfer to Fdx (Yeung, 2011). Grx4 is a highly abundant protein with ppGpp-dependent induction during stationary phase or iron depletion (Fernandes, 2005). Not a substrate for glutathione reductase. Although a deletion for grxD is in the Keio collection, it was also reported that grxD is an essential gene that could not be inactivated (Gerdes, 2003; Fernandes, 2005; Baba, 2006). grxD, but not bolA or ibaG(yrbA) mutants are hypersensitive to iron depletion (Yeung, 2011).	1787943	P0AC69	b1654	5527	JW1646	Null

ChbG(YdjC) has promiscuous phosphonoesterase activity against a xenobiotic phosphorylated phosphonate (Kheronsky, 2011). chbG(ydjC) is a gene in the chb chitobiose catabolism operon. ChbG(YdjC) is a member of the InterPro IPR002509 polysaccharide deacetylase superfamily including yeast chitin deacetylase. The chb operon is induced by N,N'-diacetylchitobiose. The chb operon was previously thought to encode a cryptic cel operon for a cellobiose degradation system. The Cel+ phenotype is due to mutations making expression chitobiose-independent, but a fully induced operon did not support growth on cellobiose, implying a mutation altering the substrate specificity is needed; several candidate mutations were noted in Genbank, but not proven to alter the specificity of the system (Keyhani, 1997). In contrast, a later study claim that mutations making the operon expression high-level constitutive by chbR and nagC mutations are sufficient for the Cel+ phenotype and that no mutations altering substrate specificity are required (Kachroo, 2007).

The E. coli K-12 Flc(CrcB) protein is a dual-topopogy membrane protein (Rapp, 2006). A Flc(CrcB) family protein from an E. coli virulence plasmid has been shown to be a homodimeric inner membrane fluoride-specific efflux channel; the membrane topologies of Flc(CrcB) family members from B. pertussis and L. acidophilus have four transmembrane helices and the Flc(CrcB) subunits have opposite orientation topologies; the CrcB family of fluoride export channels has been renamed as the Fluc family (Stockbridge, 2013). There is already a flu gene in E. coli so crcB has been renamed as flc instead of fluC, which is retained as a synonym. E. coli K-12 Flc(CrcB) is an inner membrabe proteono with four predicted transmembrane helicies (Daley, 2005). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone compensates for a loss of the normal condensin MukBEF and recondenses chromosomes decondensed by camphor treatment (Hu, 1996; Sand, 2003). A cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone increases plasmid DNA supercoiling and reduces DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutant phenotypes (Sand, 2003). A cspE-flc(crcB) double mutant confers camphor-hypersensitivity and exacerbates the phenotypes of topo IV and MukB mutants, indicating that CspE and Flc(CrcB) may have roles in maintaining condensed chromosomes, either direct or indirect, possibly through the regulation of other gene products (Sand, 2003). Multicopy expression of cspE alone confers 10-fold camphor-resistance, a cspE-flc(crcB) clone confers 100-fold resistance, and the cspE-pagP-flc(crcB) clone confers 1000-fold resistance (single flc(crcB) or pagP clones had no effect); it is not known if the pagP gene product is contributing or if the three gene clone just expresses more flc(crcB) and/or cspE (Sand, 2003).	; 1786842	P37002	b0624	2144	JW0619	CG41131

Monomeric PanM binds to tetrameric PanD and accelerates PanD self-activation by autocleavage at Ser25 in vivo and in vitro; plasmid overexpression of panD overcomes the pantothentate requirement of panM mutants; PanM(YhhK) was initially characterized in Salmonella and subsequently characterized in E. coli where it was named PanZ (Stuecker, 2012a; Stuecker, 2012b; Nozaki, 2012). In EcoGene, panM is used as the primary gene name (gene symbol) and panZ is a synonym (alternate gene symbol) so that E. coli and Salmonella orthologs will have the same gene name when possible, continuing a genetic map tradition (Bachmann, 1990; Rudd, 2000). In Salmonella, and presuambly E. coli, PanM is a degenerate GNAT family homolog that lacks acetyltransferase activity due to a missing catalytic glutamate; PanM retains the ability to bind acetyl-CoA, which is required for its PanD co-activator function (Stuecker, 2012a; Stuecker, 2012b). PanM is the first functionally characterized member of the GNAT aceytyltransferase-related Pfam PF12568 (DUF3749) family (Finn, 2014).	; 1789869	P37613	b3459	11296	JW3424	CG18193

RbbA is homologous to fungi-specific translation elongation factor 3 (EF-3). Hygromycin B inhibits RbbA ATPase and releases RbbA from ribosomes. A truncated N-terminal 47 kDa form of RbbA (the tandem ATPase domain) was previously isolated and characterized as Protein W (Kiel, 1999). YadH, YbhR, YbhS, YhhJ, and the RbbA C-terminal domain are paralogous ABC2-membrane permease family members (pfam01061/COG0842).

YhjH contains a cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase EAL domain. The increased motility of the hns suppressing E. coli yhjH clones is consistent with the model that low cyclic di-GMP favors motility over sessility. FlhDC flagellar regulon. YhjH and RflP(YdiV) are single domain EAL proteins. yhjH mutants have reduced swimming motility, dependent on ycgR and yegE: a null ycgR mutation fully suppress the yhjH motility defect; a null yegE mutation partially suppresses yhjH; a null yedQ mutation barely suppresses yhjH; a null ydaM mutation does not suppress yhjH (Figure 3A) (Pesavento, 2008). yhjH mutants have reduced swimming motility but normal swarming due to a defect in the frequency of flagellar motor switching (Girgis, 2007). The motility defect of yhjH mutations is suppressed by multicopy yfgF and by mutations in ycgR, fliZ, yfiR, yegE, crfC(yjdA), and yjcZ (Girgis, 2007).

Although YhjK activity has not yet been assayed in vitro, a yhjK mutant has an elevated level of c-di-GMP relative to a wildtype strain (Furukawa, 2012). YhjK is a dual domain cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase with a defective diguanylate cyclase central domain: the I-site (RxxD) is missing and the A-site is SGYDF in place of the GGDEF; YhjK has a C-terminal EAL domain, however the HAMP linker signaling domain was not detected (Sommerfeldt, 2009). YhjK has a HAMP signaling domain (162-232) and two transmembrane segments (12-32; 159-176) that anchor the cytoplasmic HAMP linker, EAL and defective GGDEF domains to the inner membrane. The HAMP linker signal transduction domain is detected using EBI's InterProScan (PF00672, E=5.3E-11) but produces only insignificant matches to HAMP linker profiles using NCBI's CD-Search (PF00672, E=0.15; cd06225, E=0.10); InterProScan also detects the HAMP linker domain as matching ProSite PS50885 at a slightly different location (180-236), as annotated in UniProtKB P37649.

YhjX is the only protein directly regulated by the pyruvate-sensing YpdAB two-component system: response regulator YpdB binds to the yhjX promoter region, YpdB overproduction increased yhjX expression 24-fold, and deletion of ypdABC prevented induction by the pyruvate in LB; the induction was restored by a ypdAB clone; YpdB overproduction indrectly increased btsT(yjiY) expression 4-fold since btsT(yjiY) has no YpdB binding site (Fried, 2013). yhjX expression increased 50-fold in a btsSR(yehUT) mutant, but yhjX is indirectly repressed since BtsR(YehT) does not bind the yhjX promoter region (Kraxenberger, 2012). YhjX has been experimentally shown to be an integral membrane protein (Daley, 2005; Fried, 2013). The YpdAB and BtsSR(YehUT) two-component regulators are paralogous; these two systems may be interconnected since they both regulate btsT(yjiY), directly by BtsSR(YehUT) and indirectly by YpdAB; although not noted by the authors, both sytems also regulate yhjX, indirectly by BtsSR(YehUT) and directly by YpdAB; the transporter genes yhjX and btsT(yjiY) are the only two genes significantly regulated by YpdAB and BtsSR(YehUT) (Fried, 2013). YhjX is similar to OxlT from Oxalobacter genes and may be an oxalate-formate antiporter; alternatively YhjX may be involved with pyruvate transport. YhjX may function with frc and oxc to catabolize oxalate. Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). The yhjX promoter region binds ArcA (Federowicz, 2014).

Hantz, Ph.D. thesis, Claude Bernard University, 1977, as cited by Tubeleviciute et al. (Tubeleviciute, 2014). KduI and KduD activities were initially determined in Erwinia chrysanthemi where they are required for pectin catabolism (Condemine, 1991). KDG is derived from pectin, a common plant heteropolysaccharide, although E. coli K-12 does not secrete pectinases or uptake pectin oligosaccharides and has only the core KDG regulon as compared to plant pathogens like Erwinia chrysanthemi, whose extracellular pectate lyases and intacellular oligogalacturonate lyase breaks pectin down mainly into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) monomers and to a lesser extent polygalacturonase-generated galacturonate; in E. coli K-12 galacturonate uptake and degradation is mediated by the ExuT permease and the UxaABC catabolic enzymes producing KDG, respectively, and DKI is imported by the KdgR-regulated KDG importer KdgT and catabolized to KDG by the KdgR-regulated KduID enyzymes, also producing KDG; KDG is converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by KdsK and Eda(KdsA) (Rodionov, 2004; Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, 1996). KduI and KduD activities were initially determined in Erwinia chrysanthemi where they are required for pectin catabolism; E. coli does not catabolize pectin (Condemine, 1991). The reversible KduD oxidoreductase converts DKII to KDG in vivo, displaying DKII reductase activity; the substrate for this reaction, 3-deoxy-D-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate (DKII), is also known as 3-deoxy-D-glycero-hexo-2,5-diulosonate, (4S)-4,6-dihydroxy-2,5-dioxohexanoate, or 2,5-diketo-3-deoxygluconate. KduI and KduD are inducible by galacturonate and glucuronate and are required for optimal utilization of galacturonate and glucuronate at high osmolarity, presumably substituting for salt-repressed UxaC; lactose catabolism generates intracellular hexuronates (Rothe, 2013). EC 1.1.1.125 (2-deoxy-D-gluconate 3-dehydrogenase) and EC 1.1.1.127 (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase) have 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate oxidoreductase and dehydrogenase as alternative names, respectively, leading to the previous misannotation of KduD as EC 1.1.1.125. KduD may be the hexuronate dehydrogenase required for hexuronate utilization at high osmolarity. KduD is a 20-ketosteroid reductase (a reversible 20-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.149) that catalyzes the in vitro reduction of a carbonyl group at the C20 position of steroid substrates with a hydroxyl group at position C21 including 11-deoxycorticosterone (11-DOC), 11-deoxycortisol (Reichstein's Compound S, RSS), cortisol, corticosterone, cortisone, and 21-hydroxypregnenolone; physiologically relevant Km values were determined for 11-DOC (0.23 mM) and RSS (0.19 mM) as well as low affinity substrate activities using the sugar substrates D-gluconate and 5-keto-D-gluconate (Hannermann, 2007; Tubeleviciute, 2014). 	1789208	P37769	b2842	9330	JW2810	Null

The region from leuX to yjhQ gene was once designated as prophage KpLE2 (Hayashi, 2001). Although this region contains several IS elements, it has no other phage gene homologs and has many core genes, and thus is unlikely to represent a prophage region; therefore all references to the KpLE2 prophage have been removed. The region clockwise from leuX through intB' has been designated as the PR-X prophage remnant and described as P2-like and highly deleted, although no length or right end was indicated (Casjens, 2003).

The previously reported exonuclease activity of YgdG(Xni) has been refuted due to copurification with ExoIII (Xth); purified YgdG(Xni) displayed no nuclease activities in vitro (Shafritz, 1998; Hodskinson, 2007). YgdG(Xni) binds Ssb (Hodskinson, 2007). YgdG(Xni) is homologous to the exonuclease domain of PolA (Sayers, 1994; Borodovsky, 1994). 3/19 YgdG(Xni) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007). Although both polA and ygdG(xni) deletions are viable, a double polA ygdG(xni) deletion strain is inviable (Fukushima, 2007). Although no nuclease activity has been demonstrated using purified YgdG(Xni), its homology to the PolA exonuclease domain, its DNA-binding ability, and its synthetic lethality with polA suggests that YgdG(Xni) might have in vivo exonuclease activity; perhaps needed substrates or co-factors were missing from the purified YgdG(Xni) assays (K.E.R., 2013).	; 1789162	P38506	b2798	9174	JW5446	CG56869

An mdtK(ydhE) plasmid confers resistance to norfloxacin and ethidium bromide and these cells have reduced cellular concentrations of norfloxacin and ethidium bromide (Long, 2008). An mdtK(ydhE) plasmid confers resistance to ethidium bromide, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, rhodamine 6G, acriflavine, crystal violet, norfloxacin, doxorubicin, novobiocin, berberine, benzalkonium, and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (Long, 2008).

RpoE regulon. RseP activates RpoE and releases membrane-bound RseA-RpoE complexes. Cleavage occurs around RseA membrane domain generating the N-terminal and the soluable product. rseP is an essential gene, but deletion of ompCF or ompCA (or an sRNA rseX clone, which suppresses ompCA translation) allows growth. RseP or some other protease degrades RseA in the released complexes. The RseA periplasmic domain must be first clipped or degraded by DegS before it is a substrate for RseP. RseP is related to the E. faecalis Eep protein involved in bacterial regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). RseP has been topology mapped using protein fusions. RseP is reported to degrade RpoE and RpoH in vitro and to be an negative, not positive, effector of RpoE action in vivo, but the physiological relevance and/or accuracy of this has subsequently been strongly challenged (Dartigalongue, 2001).	; 1786373	P0AEH1	b0176	603	JW0171	CG77012

Efficient translation of polyproline-containing proteins is the function of EF-P and requires the EpmAB-mediated lysine34 lysylation (Doerfel, 2012; Ude, 2012). A third and final EF-P post-translation modification enzyme EpmC(YfcM) is identified as EF-P-Lys34 hydroxylase; EpmC(YfcM) acts after beta-lysinylation of Lys34 by EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK); EpmC(YfcM) adds an oxygen atom to the C5 position of Lys34 and does not modify the added beta-lysine; YjeA and YjeK were renamed as EpmA and EpmB, respectively (Peil, 2012). EpmA(YjeA) and EpmB(YjeK) were predicted to be responsible for the modification of EF-P Lys34 with spermidine, but Lys34 is actually modified with another lysine, not spermidine; epmB(yjeK) is in the efp genetic neighborhood in many strains and all genomes that have the conserved Lys34 in EF-P have epmB(yjeK) orthologs; EpmB(YjeK) is a lysine 2,3-aminomutase homolog (but in a different clade) (Bailly, 2010; Yanagisawa, 2010). EpmB(YjeK) is a homolog of Clostridium subterminale KamA and has weak lysine 2,3-aminomutase activity, but its specific activity is only 0.1% of that of KamA and produces a slightly different product, indicating this may not be a physiologically relevant activity in E. coli (Behshad, 2006).

The constitutive promoter for UlaR has not been mapped, and a Northern blot of the ulaG mRNA has not been performed, but since induction of ulaG by ascorbate addition or ulaR mutation does not increase expression of a ulaR-lacZ fusion there probably is a transcription terminator preceding the UlaR promoter in the 107 bp ulaG-ulaR intergenic regiom; the ulaR promoter (RpoE class) with a +1 in the ulaG stop codon, predicted at RegulonDB, does not meet this criterion (Campos, 2002; Campos, 2004; Huerta, 2003).

Purified UlaG has in vitro L-ascorbate-6-phosphate lactonase activity (Garces, 2010). UlaG has phosphodiesterase activity with model substrate bis-pNPP (Kuznetsova, 2005). An early pathway proposed for L-ascorbate catabolism did not include a predicted function for the divergent ulaG gene, depicting a spontaneous hydrolysis of L-ascorbate to 3-keto-L-gulonate outside the cell, but the authors also considered L-ascorbate import and phosphorylation via the PTS system followed by intracellular hydrolysis, as the pathway has since been shown to be (Yew, 2002). Spontaneous hydrolysis of L-ascorbate directly to 3-keto-L-gulonate is slow, but L-ascorbate metabolism in animals can proceed by nonenzymatic oxidation to dehydroascorbate, an unstable lactone that hydrolyzes spontaneously to 2,3-di-keto-l-gulonate (Zhang, 2003). 2,3-di-keto-l-gulonate is taken up directly by the YiaMNO TRAP transporter (Thomas, 2006). The divergent ulaG-ulaABCDEF operon is repressed by UlaR(YjfQ) looping and is induced by L-ascorbate in the medium, which is converted to the molecular inducer L-ascorbate-6-P during import by the PTS system (Campos, 2002; Zhang, 2003; Campos, 2004; Garces, 2008). The constitutive promoter for UlaR has not been mapped, and a Northern blot of the ulaG mRNA has not been performed, but since induction of ulaG by ascorbate addition or ulaR mutation does not increase expression of a ulaR-lacZ fusion there probably is a transcription terminator preceding the UlaR promoter in the 107 bp ulaG-ulaR intergenic regiom; the ulaR promoter (RpoE class) with a +1 in the ulaG stop codon, predicted at RegulonDB, does not meet this criterion (Campos, 2002; Campos, 2004; Huerta, 2003).

The YpdAB-regulated transporter gene yhjX is induced by high (>600 micromolar) concentrations of pyruvate while the BtsSR-regulated high-affinity pyruvate symporter gene btsT is induced by low (<5 micromolar) concentrations of pyruvate (Behr, 2017b). The YpdAB and BtsSR(YehUT) two-component regulators are paralogous; these two systems may be interconnected since they both regulate btsT(yjiY), directly by BtsSR(YehUT) and indirectly by YpdAB; although not noted by the authors, both sytems also regulate yhjX, indirectly by BtsSR(YehUT) and directly by YpdAB; the transporter genes yhjX and btsT(yjiY) are the only two genes significantly regulated by YpdAB and BtsSR(YehUT) (Fried, 2013). A suggestion that yjiY is oppE is based upon genetic mapping that places oppE in this region and the peptide utilization phenotype of its paralog cstA. In Salmonella typhimurium, a btsT(yjiY) mutant affects the formation of flagella, has reduced colonization of mouse intestine, and is defective in the uptake of some peptides (Garai, 2015). A btsSR ypdAB quadruple mutant has a higher level of persistor cells than wildtype after ampicillin treatment of stationary phase, but not exponential phase, cells (Vilhena, 2017).

The YabP pentapeptide repeat consensus A(T,N)(P,h)DG (h=hydrophobic aa, only the A is invariant) differs somewhat from the published pentapeptide repeat consensuses A(D,N)LXX and (S,T,A,V)(D,N)(L,F)(S,T,R)G (Bateman, 1998; Vetting, 2006). YabP appears to be distantly related to the COG1357 family and apart from the easily identified 7 pentapeptide repeats appears to have degenerated or evolved, possibly acquiring a new function. One N was added after genome coordinate 59052 to hypothetically reverse a yadP' frameshift and reconstruct YabP' with X194 at the frameshift site; the missing base in yabP marked by an N is probably the G present at this location in intact versions of the yabP gene, coding for Gly194. An intact copy of YabP' (UniProt L3L3Z3) with no mismatches other than the X194G is found in the E. coli strain KTE51 genome sequence (Genbank ANUD01000013, locus_tag=A1SA_00636). Alleles of YabP in various other E. coli strains have deletions or insertions of pentapeptide repeats in various phases of the pentapeptide repeat, for example E. coli KTE130 (Genbank ASVN01000010, locus_tag=A1YG_00516) which has a single pentapeptide repeat deletion relative to K-12 and KTE51 at the site of the K-12 frameshift mutation. A PDB structure distantly related to the pentapeptide repeat domain of YabP is PDB 2J8K from N. punctiforme, which forms highly symmetric right-handed quadrilateral beta-helices similar to those found in MfpA from M. tuberculosis, a DNA gyrase inhibitor thought to be a B-form DNA mimic (Hedge, 2005; Vetting, 2007). YadP is restricted to E. coli and several alleles are misannotated as undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (e.g. UniProt H4VRD6) or non-LEE-encoded type III secreted effector (e.g. UniProt E8J137). An expression clone over-producing the last 52 residues of yabP' (labeled as yabQ, the pre-pseudogene reconstruction name for that fragment) has been reported to suppress the slow growth phenotype of an rsgA deletion mutant, but the physiological relevance of this is unclear (Campbell, 2008).	1786242	P39220	b4659	194; 192	JW0055	Null

Although YbdG has a conductance similar to MscM and was previously proposed to be a component of the originally observed MscM activity, identification of YjeP as the protein responsible for the original MscM activity indicates that YjeP should be renamed as MscM (Edwards, 2012).

E. coli pmrD is induced by low Mg(2+) in a PhoP-dependent manner, thus the E. coli prmD product itself is non-functional, as shown by the fact that replacing the E. coli chromosomal prmD with the Salmonella prmD confers the Salmonella low Mg(2+) response to E. coli (Winfield, 2004). Although PmrA represses pmrD transcription in Salmonella, pmrD is not regulated by pmrA in E. coli (Winfield, 2004). A Salmonella prmD mutation eliminates the polymyxin B resistance induced in low Mg(2+), and this defect is corrected by a complementing Salmonella prmD+ clone (Kox, 2000); prmD+ E. coli K-12 does not show low Mg(+2)-induced polymyxin B resistance at all (Kato, 2007). However, citing their unpublished results, Kox (2000) report that E. coli K-12 prmD can fully rescue the Salmonella prmD defect, and they conclude that prmD is functional. Although this experimental result is not refuted, repeated or discussed in Kato (2007), it seems as if this unpublished observation has been retracted.

Two components Factor A (NuvA, 9.3) and Factor B (NuvB, ~45') were originally shown to be required for tRNA s(4)U8 modification with NuvC being the pyridoxal phosphate requiring factor; despite the mapping discrepancy it seems likely that IscS (57.3') is Factor C (NuvC) and ThiI (9.3') is Factor A (NuvA) (Kambampati, 2000). IscU and IscS form a complex (Agar, 2000; Tokumoto, 2002; Kato, 2002; Prischi, 2010). The IscU-IscS complex is stabilized by a covalent disifide bond between Cys328 of IscS and Cys63 of IscU (Kato, 2002). YnjE, IscS, MoaD and MoeB form a complex in vivo (Dahl, 2011). IscU has been classified as a "complex-orphan" protein that is largely unstructured unless bound to a partner, i.e. IscS (Prischi, 2010). 2/409 peptide masses from MS analysis indicate that a start codon eight codons upstream is utilized, but this conflicts with protein sequencing results (Maillet, 2007).

A yfgZ null mutant grows poorly on minimal media, is hypersensitive to oxidative stress, and has reduced MiaB activity; YgfZ may remove the formaldehyde from Fe-S enzymes like MiaB by transferring formaldehyde to tetrahydrofolate (Waller, 2010). YgfZ binds folate and tetrahydrofolate and is dependent upon folates for activity (Teplyakov, 2004; Waller, 2010). ygfZ mutants grow slowly, especially at low temperature; the slow growth of ygfZ mutants is suppressed by an mnmE mutation (Ote, 2006). yfgZ mutants are sensitive to plumbagin and YfgZ is involved in plubagin degradation (Lin, 2010). ygfZ expression is induced by plumbagin (Chen, 2006). YgfZ is involved in regulating the level of ATP-dnaA; a null ygfZ mutation suppresses hda mutations (Ote, 2006). YgfZ is structurally similar to the enzyme dimethylglycine oxidase involved in the betaine catabolism pathway (DMGO) of A. globiformis (Teplyakov, 2004) . YgfZ has a yeast homolog, CAF17, that is a component of the transcriptional regulatory complex. YfgZ can form covalent dimers in vitro but the significance of this in vivo is unclear; Cys228 is the only critical conserved residue required for phenotypic complementation (Hasnain, 2012).	1789265	P0ADE8	b2898	9512	JW2866	Null

E. coli NMN amidohydrolase is required for the recycling of NAD (via PNC IV) catalyzing the deamidation of NMN to NaMN; unpublished results of S. Sirilan and B. Olivera were cited for the initial report of an NMN amidohydrolase activity in crude extracts of E. coli (Manlapaz-Fernandez, 1973). NMN amidohydrolase was partially purified, but the gene was not identified; NMN amidohydrolase has a native MW of 33K (and an observed pI of 5.3) indicating PncC dimerization; NMN amidohydrolase exhibits a pH optimum of approximately 9 (Hillyard, 1981). PncC is is part of the most active pathway, PNC IV, for recycling NAD in E. coli; a second pathway PNC VI is also present. The assignment of the gene name pncC was originally suggested for the NMN amidohydrolase structural gene in Salmonella (Foster, 1979). The pncC gene was mismapped twice in Salmonella. The initial mapping of pncC in Salmonella was based on a penicillin selection against wildtype that could catabolize NMN; mutants with a pnuA allele of nadR, whose enzymatic activity is required for NMN uptake by assisting in the nicotinamide riboside substrate conversion to NMN and release from the PnuC transporter (Foster, 1979; Kinney, 1979; Foster, 1987; Foster, 1990). A second misidentification of the Salmonella pncC gene occurred when a selection for NMN catabolism mutants identified a gene (aphA) with a metabolic activity required for NMN uptake, not the catabolic enzyme NMN amidohydrolase; the periplasmic AphA is required for the de-phosphorylation of NMN to form nicotinamide riboside, the PnuC transporter substrate (Cheng, 1995; Grose, 2005).	1789052	P0A6G3	b2700	8882	JW2670	Null

STAS domains are found fused to transport domains in sulfate transporters, are found in some anti-sigma factors, and may bind NTPs. Mutations in any one of the mla genes confers sensitivity to SDS-EDTA and lead to accumulation of phospholipid in the outer leaflet of the OM (Malinverni, 2009).

A 28 aa signal anchor facilitates export, but the signal sequence is not cleaved, anchoring MlaD to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane (Malinverni, 2009). MlaD(YrbD) is encoded in an operon with ABC transporter homologs and is predicted to be an IM-anchored periplasmic phospholipid binding protein; the predicted periplasmic phospholipid-binding protein MlaC may chaperone the deliver of phospholipids to MlaD. Alternatively, MlaD may assist in docking the putative MlaC-PL complex to the MlaEF core transporter for direct transfer of PLs to the inner membrane.

LptC binds LPS in vitro and LptA can displace LPS from LptC, but not the reverse, consistent with an LPS export pathway (Tran, 2010). Depletion of LptC results in rifampicin/bile salts sensitivity, indicative of an outer membrane integrity defect (Sperandeo, 2006). LptC has an uncleaved signal anchor tethering periplasmic LptC to the inner membrane (Sperandeo, 2007, Tran, 2010). The failure to produce a viable deletion strain indicates that lptC is an essential gene (Baba, 2006). LptB has been reported to be essential based on depletion of ara-controlled expression (Sperandeo, 2006). The insertion of a minitransposon with an ara-inducible outward promoter at codon 134 of lptC(yrbK) has been reported to be viable but to exhibit a cold-sensitive growth phenotype, possibly due to poor ara-inducible expression of the downstream essential lptA(yhbN) gene (Serina, 2004).	1789591	P0ADV9	b3199	10508	JW3166	Null

The use of the term transglycolase is ambiguous as it can describe both lytic and synthetic peptidoglycan activities, therefore glycosyltransferase is preferred (Di Berardino, 1996). MtgA lacks a penicillin binding domain and therefore is penicillin-insensitive. MtgA is a membrane-bound periplasmic enzyme that has an uncleaved signal anchor (Di Berardino, 1996).

TsaBCDE are necessary and sufficient for tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine modification in vitro (Deutsch, 2012). TsaC(YrdC) has in vitro threonine-dependent ATPase activity generating AMP (Deutsch, 2012). TsaD(YgjD) was proposed to be a threonine-bicarbonate ligase producing N-carbamoylthreonine which was proposed to then be transferred to the N(6) group of tRNA(NNU) A37 by TsaC(YrdC) (El Yacoubi, 2011). TsaC(YrdC) but not paralog YciO is required for synthesis of t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine of ANN decoding tRNA(NNU)s (El Yacoubi, 2009). TsaA paralog YciO does not complement a tsaC(yrdC) mutational defect in t(6)A37 synthesis (Gerdes, 2011). TsaC(YrdC) efficiently binds to unmodified but not modified uncharged tRNA (El Yacoubi, 2009; Harris, 2011). TsaC(YrdC) was proposed to be a threonylcarbamoyl transferase subunit and part of a heteromultimeric complex as it binds unmodified tRNA, threonine and ATP (Harris, 2011). A tsaC(yrdC) deletion suppresses a prfA mutation and can only survive in a prfA mutant. tsaC(yrdC) mutants were observed to be defective in ribosome maturation and was named rimN, but this could be a secondary effect due to its essential role in tRNA(NNU) t(6)A37 modification (Kaczanowska, 2005).	2367210	P45748	b3282	10766	JW3243	Null

Although originally reported not to have beta-lactamase activity, a subsequent study demonstrated that AmpH has a very weak beta-lactamase activity using nitrocefin as the substrate; this activity is about 0.1% of the rate for AmpC, a known weak beta-lactamase (Henderson, 1997; González-Leiza, 2011). A cleavable 21 aa type I signal peptide for AmpH is strongly predicted by SignalP and cleavage at this site has been confirmed by mass loss observed using LC-MS, although since the mature N-terminus was not sequenced AmpH is not in the Verified Set; the 23 aa cleaved N-terminal sequence reported includes the N-terminal MG dipeptide added by the pET vector (González-Leiza, 2011).

DgcN(YfiN) has an N-terminal predicted periplasmic domain flanked by two TM segments and has a C-terminal cytoplasmic diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain. The N-terminal domain is probably a signal input domain because there is a HAMP linker signal transduction domain (residues 183-236) between the periplasmic domain and the GGDEF domain. The HAMP linker signal transduction domain is detected using EBI's InterProScan as matching ProSite PS50885, as annotated in UniProtKB P46139, but has an insignificant match to a HAMP linker Pfam profile (PF00672, E=0.15) using NCBI's CD-Search. The P. aeruginosa ortholog DgcN(YfiN) is an inner membrane-associated diguanylate cyclase whose activity is negatively regulated by the periplasmic protein YfiR; the P. aeruginosa OM lipoprotein YfiB counteracts YfiR inhibition of DgcN(YfiN); P. aeruginosa DgcN(YfiN) regulates exopolysaccharide production (Malone, 2010). YfiR may interact with the predicted N-terminal periplasmic domain of DgcN(YfiN).	1788956	P46139	b2604	8570	JW2585	Null

An IS1 mutation in the promoter region of yrfF, which may cause a reduction but not elimination of YrfF, in the E. coli MC4100 K-12 strain causes mucoidy and macrophage-resistance (pathoadaptation) (Miskinyte, 2013). yrfF is classified as an essential gene in E. coli because of the inability to construct a deletion mutant of yrfF (Baba, 2006). As part of a global transposon footprinting, two insertions in yrfF were found, leading the authors to categorize yrfF as a non-essential gene; these insertions may still allow for a partially functional YrfF protein, or they may have acquired suppressor mutations reducing or eliminating colanic acid production (Gerdes, 2003). YrfF is related to UmoB(P.m.) which upregulates flhDC in P. mirabilis. The Salmonella yrfF ortholog igaA is also called mucM, due to its mucoid mutant phenotype. The nudE-yrfF divergent operon promoter region binds ArcA and ArcA activates yrfF expression (Federowicz, 2014).	1789801	P45800	b3398	11090	JW3361	Null

The yhgF gene is orthologous to the essential B. pertussis tex (toxin expression) transcription factor gene that negatively regulates toxin production (Fuchs, 1996). YhgF is homologous to the essential yeast transcription elongation factor Spt6, which is conserved from yeast to humans, and the human ortholog has a role in HIV pathogenesis (Close, 2001). A high-throughput screen for new virulence factors identified the P. aeruginosa tex/yhgF gene as being required for rat lung infection (Potvin, 2003). The S. pneumoniae Tex/YhgF ortholog is not required for growth or pneumolysin expression; a tex/yhgF deletion mutant is out-competed by a wild type strain in culture; purified S. pneumoniae Tex/YhgF binds RNA and DNA (He, 2006). Purified C. perfringens Tex/YhgF binds a subset of toxin mRNAs and a tex deletion strain grows normally but has reduced toxin expression (Abe, 2010). Purified Tex/YhgF from P. aeruginosa binds ssDNA more than ten-fold tighter than it binds ssDNA, dsDNA or dsRNA but does not have nuclease activity; Tex/YhgF also binds a DNA/RNA hybrid; nucleic acid binding required the S1 domain although the weak binding to short ssRNAs indicates that the other potential nucleic acid binding domains also participate in nucleic acid binding; it appears that dsDNA binding by the variant HTH domain would be occluded by the rest of the protein although ssRNA-binding is possible (Johnson, 2008). YhgF is highly conserved; sequences, motifs, and structures identify six domains in the Tex family proteins, here defined by serial non-overlapping matches to five InterPro signatures; both the InterPro and the parent database profile accessions are provided: (1) a potential DNA-binding N-terminal HTH structural domain (IPR023319, CATH 1.10.10.650; residues 2-110), (2) a Tex-specific domain (IPR023323, CATH 1.10.3500.10; residues 111-322), (3) a YqgF/RNaseH-like domain that lacks a critical carboxylate active site residue but may still bind DNA/RNA hybrids (IPR012337; Superfamily SSF53098; residues 323-469), (4) tandem RuvA domain 2-like domains each with two potentially nucleic acid-binding helix-hairpin-helix motifs for a total of four HhH tandem motifs; the second HhH pair is not detected by any of the Pfam HhH family motifs and are not well-formed in the P. aeruginosa YhgF structures (IPR010994, Superfamily SSF47781; 470-558, 560-632), and (5) a highly conserved S1 domain with a nucleic acid-binding OB-fold (IPR012340, Superfamily SSF50249, 638-723). The N-terminal HTH domain of YhgF, which was identified in the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa YhgF but was not predicted by sequence analysis, is not similar to MtlR as previously proposed; the V. parahaemolyticus MtlR crystal structure reveals no HTH domain (Fuchs, 1996; Johnson, 2008; Tan, 2009). otherPDB(P. aeruginosa): 3BZC,3BZK (Johnson, 2008). otherPDB(P. aeruginosa): 2OCE (Jin, X., Min, T., Burley, S.K., and Shapiro, L., 2007, unpublished).	87082262	P46837	b3407	11120	JW3370	Null

A yggS glyA double mutant is a synthetic lethal (Nichols, 2011). YggS is homologous to the N-terminal domain of alanine racemase but does not have racemase activity towards any of the 20 L- or D-amino acids (Ito, 2013). YggS is not required to help YggT in the K+ uptake rescue of TK420 (lacking K+ uptake systems Trk, Kup and Kdp) (Ito, 2009). YhfX and YggS are single domain proteins related to the N-terminal domains of both synthetic (Alr) and catabolic (DsdX) alanine racemases, which contain the covalently PLP-modified lysine residue N6-(pyridoxal phosphate)lysine; since YhfX and YggS lack the C-terminal Alr/DadX domains containing the L-alanine-specific binding site and proton-accepting active site, it is unlikely that these enzymes have alanine racemase activity. YggS has a covalently PLP-modified Lys36 N6-(pyridoxal phosphate)lysine residue (Sulzenbacher, G., Gruez, A., Spinelli, S., Roig-Zamboni, V., Pagot, F., Bignon, C., Vincentelli, R., Cambillau, C., unpublished PDB structure 1W8G, 2006).

It appears only the stop codon of the ancestral yghF was deleted, fusing on an additional 12 C-terminal residues. The yghFED promoter is active and the yghF gene is possibly functional despite the extra C-terminal residues present in the K-12 version of the gene, which are: YRLFCPPYWKKS. A CTG start codon 7 codons upstream is predicted to be the start codon since it makes a much better signal peptide, but since CTG is used so rarely as a start codon, this needs to be verified.

Purified SslE(YghJ) from EPEC strain H10407 degrades MUC2 and MUC3 intestinal mucins in vitro, and an active site mutation abrogates activity (Luo, 2014). SslE(YghJ) is secreted by the type II secretion system T2SS-beta, is localized on the cell surface of pathogenic E. coli cells, and is required for biofilm formation, colonization and virulence (Moriel, 2010; Baldi, 2013; Nesta, 2014). An sslE mutation has no effect on adherence and biofilm formation in an atypical EPEC strain (Hernandes, 2013). The non-pathogenic E. coli W strain secretes SslE (Decanio, 2013). Since K-12 lacks an intact T2SS-beta it is unlikely that K-12 secretes SslE. Although sslE(yghJ) is adjacent to the gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) genes, it is not required for Gsp-beta function, as determined for the ETEC strain H10407 which has an intact gsp-beta (T2SS-beta) operon (Strozen, 2012). SslE(YghJ) is homologous to V. cholerae accessory colonization factor AcfD. SslE(YghJ) has a central DUF4092 domain. SslE(YghJ) has an M60 zinc metallopeptidase-like C-terminal domain (Pfam PF13402) associated with mucinase activity (Nakjang, 2012). The first 23 aa of SslE(YghJ) are predicted to be a type II signal peptide and the N-terminus of SslE from the prototype human EPEC strain E2348/69 is blocked from Edman degradation (Baldi, 2012).	48994912	P0CK95	b4466	174096	JW5925	Null

Curiously, of 45 non-K-12 E. coli genomes with YghO alleles, only one (strain LF82) annotates the conserved yghO start codon (LF82_3204). In K-12 there are three upstream in-frame ATG codons encoded in IS5LO that possibly could be used to express a hybrid 'YghO. 	1789354	Q46840	b2981	9779	JW5848	Null

KDG is derived from pectin, a common plant heteropolysaccharide, although E. coli K-12 does not secrete pectinases or uptake pectin oligosaccharides and has only the core KDG regulon as compared to plant pathogens like Erwinia chrysanthemi, whose extracellular pectate lyases and intacellular oligogalacturonate lyase breaks pectin down mainly into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) monomers and to a lesser extent polygalacturonase-generated galacturonate; in E. coli K-12 galacturonate uptake and degradation is mediated by the ExuT permease and the UxaABC catabolic enzymes producing KDG, respectively, and DKI is imported by the KdgR-regulated KDG importer KdgT and catabolized to KDG via DKII by the KdgR-regulated KduID enyzymes; KDG is then converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by KdsK and Eda(KdsA) (Rodionov, 2004; Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, 1996). KduI and KduD are inducible by galacturonate and glucuronate and are required for optimal utilization of galacturonate and glucuronate at high osmolarity, presumably substituting for salt-repressed UxaC; cloned KduI alone was able to isomerize hexuronates in vivo, but the specific set of hexuronate substrates is unknown (Rothe, 2013). KduI is a prototype for a family of hexuronate ketol-isomerases in the cupin-like superfamily (PF04962) (Crowther, 2005). 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate is also known as 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate or 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI). The product of this reaction, 3-deoxy-D-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate (DKII), is also known as 3-deoxy-D-glycero-hexo-2,5-diulosonate, (4S)-4,6-dihydroxy-2,5-dioxohexanoate, or 2,5-diketo-3-deoxygluconate.	1789209	Q46938	b2843	9332	JW2811	Null

RAYT is an IS200-related transposase whose orthologs are always flanked by a pair of REP clusters (BIMEs); transient DNA linkages to a tyrosine residue are a hallmark of IS200-related transposases; REP-containing genomes without rayT genes have a ten-fold lower number of REPs in their genomes; RAYT does not seem to mobilize itself in host genomes, but it is hypothesized that RAYT can mobilize REPs in trans, indicating that REPs may be a new class of nonautonomous transposable elements (TEs) thus providing a mechanism for REP multiplication and dispersal around bacterial genomes (Nunvar, 2010). REP doublets, renamed as REPINs, may be the mobilizable unit of a REP nonautonomous TE and REP singlets may be degraded doublets (Bertels, 2011).	1786422	Q47152	b0228	779	JW0218	Null

YbbN assists in refolding of DnaN, and ybbN mutants produce anucleated cells and have DNA replication defects (Le, 2011). YbbN has two tandem C-terminal TPR-like repeat domains. The function of YbbN as both an thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase and as a chaperone is controversial (Vlamis-Gardikas, 2008): YbbN has been reported to oxidize cysteines of RNase A and to have chaperone activity (Caldas, 2006), but this is partially contradicted by a report that YbbN cannot reduce oxidized insulin and has no chaperone activity on citrate synthase (Pan, 2006). This contradiction is substantially resolved by a followup to the Caldas (2006) study which found no evidence for YbbN oxidoreductase activity in vivo and and agree with Pan (2006) that there is no significant in vitro chaperone activity of YbbN alone on citrate syntase, but there is a strong stimulation of DnaK chaperone activity on citrate syntase, thus YbbN is a DnaK co-chaperone (Kthiri, 2008).

The YajL chaperone forms mixed disulfides with target proteins, preferentially at sulfenylated cysteines (Le, 2012; Gautier, 2012). YajL stimulates refolding of citrate cynthase in vitro, and a yajL mutant has increased protein aggregation during aerobiosis, is sensitive to oxidative stress, and has reduced mRNA levels for the aggregated proteins (Kthiri, 2010). YajL has been mistakenly described as ThiJ, involved in thiamine metabolism. This phenotype is now attributed to the adjacent thiI gene (T.

The synonym nuvA is assigned to thiI: a nuvA mutant is near-UV resistant and maps to 9.3' (Mueller, 1998). ThiI has rhodanase and THUMP domains. Two reports of thiI complementation of nuvC were noted in Taylor (1998): footnote 3 cites (Mueller, 1998), but that complemented "nuvC" allele was not the original nuvC allele but a thiI mutant with the same phenotype isolated using the same procedure; footnote 2 attributes the complementation to C. Kinsland and T. P. Begley, unpublished results, and these results ars still unpublished. ThiI probably transfers sulfur to adenylated substrates. Two components Factor A (NuvA, 9.3) and Factor B (NuvB, ~45') were originally shown to be required for tRNA s(4)U8 modification with NuvC being the pyridoxal phosphate requiring factor; despite the mapping discrepancy it seems likely that IscS (57.3') is Factor C (NuvC) and ThiI (9.3') is Factor A (NuvA) (Kambampati, 2000).	; 1786625	P77718	b0423	1470	JW0413	CG56890

A ybgI mutation is one of many selected in a strain evolved for resistance to high levels of ionizing radiation; a single ybgI deletion mutant has a 2-3 orders of magnitude drop in survival after radiation exposure as compared to a ybgI+ strain (Byrne, 2014). Although YbgI is labeled as a putative GTP cyclohydrolase in many annotations of YbgI orthologs, there are several reasons to consider a substrate related to but distinct from GTP for YbgI. First, GTP cyclohydrolase 1 activity has been purified from E. coli and only FolE was isolated (Yim, 1976). Second, a folE mutant has a phenotype that cannot be satisfied by a presumably still intact copy of ybgI (Klaus, 2005). Third, the amino acid sequence identity between HP0959 and YbgI is only 27% (29/105) and only the last 101 amino acids align to YbgI using blastp; this is usually considered as too divergent to assume isofunctional orthology. Fourth, YbgI provides significant protection from radiation damage and may be involved in the degradation of radiation-damaged nucleotides; ybgI linkage (genetic neighborhood) to two genes involved in DNA repair, nei and phr, is conserved across many bacterial genomes perhaps indicating that they work together; consistent with this hypothesis the Phr product is a DNA photolyase that repairs cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers in DNA and Nei is part of the damaged base excision repair (BER) pathway. There is some evidence from high-throughput studies that YbgIJK-Nei might be a protein complex. YbgI is a member of the widely conserved protein family UPF0135. YbgI has a dinuclear metal site.

The first 17 aa of YafY are a type II signal peptide (Matsuyama, unpublished, cited in Miyadai, 2004). Although overproduction of YafY induces degP expression, YjfS does not; chimeric protein experiments demonstrate that the N- and C- termini of YafY have the degP stimulatory determinants (Miyadai, 2004). Originally, the annotation of yafY was fused to the upstream pseudogene ykfK. It is possible that a YkfK-YafW chimeric pseudogene product is made in vivo, but no function would be expected since cleavage of the type II signal is likely to be blocked in any chimeric protein synthesized. Expression of the native YafY lipoprotein gene in the chromosome has not yet been reported. E. coli B has a third protein in this family (UniProtKB: A2UFU7), 55% identical to YafY and YfjS, that demonstrates conservation of the shorter ORFs and their lipoprotein signals in this novel prophage gene family.	1786445	P77365	b0251	853	JW0240	Null

OmpL has been proposed to be a sulpholipid porin because it might be the last gene in the yih(squ) operon encoding the sulphoglycolysis pathway; an ompL mutant can still utilize sulphoquinovose (SQ) (Denger, 2014). The cysteine and glutathione transport through OmpL is consistent with sulphoquinovose or sulpholipid diffusion but the small pore size might not be consistent with sulpholipid diffusion; if OmpL is a sulphoquinovose (SQ) porin, it is not required for SQ utilization; alternatively sulpholipids may be imported through an unknown lipid importer. An ompL null mutation has been reported to suppress dsbA mutant phenotypes, exhibit mild DTT sensitivity, slow growth and be M13 resistant, but these findings have been subsequently refuted (Dartigalongue, 2000; Sardesai, 2003).	1790307	P76773	b3875	12659	JW3846	Null

YfhM has been detected as a membrane-bound homotrimer although an earlier report found N-terminal modifed soluble YfhM to be monomeric (Doan, 2008; Maddalo, 2011). In vitro, E. coli K-12 MG1655 YfhM binds, covalently links, and inhibits by sequestering equine neutrophil elastase (HNE), a serine proteinase probably encountered during saprophytically colonization of mammalian hosts by non-pathogenic E. coli strains; the YfhM-HNE complex splits into 103 kDa (YfhM'-HNE) and 79 kDa (YfhM') fragments (Doan, 2008).

NhoA is acetylated at Lys214 and at the C-terminal Lys281; NhoA is deacetylated by CobB, acetylation and deacytylation affects NhoA activity (Zhang, 2013). RcsB is acetylated at Lys180 by Pka(YfiQ) in vitro blocking its ability to bind to DNA, and Lys180 is deacetylated by CobB in vitro (Thao, 2010). Acetyl CoA synthase Acs is activated by CobB-mediated deacetylation of K609 in Salmonella (Starai, 2002). E. coli CobB deacetylates the Acs K609 peptide in vitro (Zhao, 2004). Protein acetyltransferase in Salmonella inhibits acetyl CoA synthase Acs by acetylating residue K609 (Starai, 2004). More than 100 proteins have acetylated lysines in E. coli (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2008). CobB may have a limited role in general protein lysine deacetylation since only four protein bands were changed in an E. coli cobB mutant (Zhang, 2008). cobB is named after its Salmonella ortholog and has no known cobalamin function in E. coli. CobB can deacetylate CheY in vitro and in vivo, reducing FliM binding and chemotaxis (Li, 2010). cobB is a mutational phenotypic suppressor of a cheA cheZ double mutation (Li, 2010). CobB has been reported to have a weak protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, although this was subsequently refuted (Frye, 1999; Landry, 2000). CobB can catalyze an NAD-nicotinamide exchange reaction, which is dependent on the presence of acetyllysine, alone or in proteins, indicative of formation of an enzyme-ADP-ribose intermediate during the NAD-dependent deacetylation reaction (Landry, 2000). The CobB start has been moved up to Met-38, removing 37 aa that are not conserved, however verification is required because the upstream start has a good RBS and might be utilized in E. coli if transcribed (Maillet, 2007).	1787364	P75960	b1120	3781	JW1106	Null

CitT is a member of the IT (Ion Transporter) superfamily (Prakash, 2003). CitT belongs to the ST(3) structural class based on hydropathy profile (Lolkema, 2003). The N-terminal periplasmic sensor domain of CitA functions as a high-affinity citrate receptor (Kaspar, 2002). E. coli cannot use citrate as a carbon and energy source for aerobic growth like Klebsiella does (Koser, 1924). Citrate can be catabolized during anaerobic growth in the presence of an oxidizable co-substrate such as glucose, lactose or glycerol; the co-substrate provides needed reducing power (Lütgens, 1980). Aerobic utilzation of citrate is blocked by low CitT transporter expression, which can be overcome using a plasmid-encoded transporter (Pos, 1998). In addition to inducing the cit operon and citAB, adding citrate to anaerobic cultures up-regulates the mdh gene needed to convert the oxoaloacetate prodcut to malate (Yamamoto, 2008). The cytoplasmic transmitter domain of autophosphorylated CitA transphosphorylates the CitB receiver domain, causing the CitB DNA-binding output HTH domain to bind to the citCDEFXGT-citAB divergent promoter region and activate transcription of both operons; the reduction of CitA Cys529 is essential for autophosphorylation, perhaps acting as an oxygen-sensing inhibition mechanism, restricting cit gene expression to the anaerobic growth conditions that enable citrate-glucose co-fermentation (Yamamoto, 2008; Yamamoto, 2009). In addition to its role in citrate utilization, CitAB(DpiBA) may be involved in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance; the citC-T and citAB(dpiBA) operons are induced by beta-lactam treatment and shifting an ftsI(ts) strain to the non-permissive temperature, in a citB(dpiA)-independent mechanism; both treatments also induce the lexA-, recA-dependent SOS response, dependent upon the citB(dpiA) induction, and lexA or recA mutants block the SOS-dependent antibiotic-induced induction of the cit genes; the antibiotic MICs are not affected by citA or citB mutations, viability of a citB(dpiA) mutant is reduced 10-fold as compared to wildtype cells after overnight antibiotic exposure in liquid cultures (Miller, 2004). Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance (Hirakawa, 2003). Deletion of citAB(dpiBA) did not change the sensitivity to 240 antibiotics and other growth inhibitors; likewise growth was unaltered in 1000 other growth-based assays such as various carbon and nitrogen source utilizations; the anaerobic utilization of citrate was not tested (Zhou, 2003). In vivo overproduced CitAB(DpiBA) stimulates the citC promoter and represses the appY promoter (Ingmar, 1998). Among other functions, the global transcriptional regulator AppY stimulates expression of the anaerobically-induced energy metabolism operons hyaA-F and cbdABX-appA (Brøndsted, 1996; Atlung, 1996; Atlung, 1997). Overproduced CitA(DpiB) destabilizes pSC101 (and other) plasmid inheritance, hence the synonyms dpiAB, and induces the SOS repsonse, acting by CitB(DpiA) binding to the AT-rich plasmid ori region and the chromosomal origin, respectively; citAB(dpiBA) mutants have no effect on plasmid inheritance (Ingmer, 1998; Miller, 2003). The citA(criR) gene was identified as a transcriptional regulator of the ipa pathogenicity island in Shigella flexneri, but E. coli K-12 does not have the ipa genes (Qi, 1996; Walker, 2002). ChiX(RybC,MicM) regulates citAB(dpiBA) mRNA; citAB(dpiBA) mRNA may be a ChiX trap-mRNA (also called an RNA decoy) (Mandin, 2009).	1786829	P0AE74	b0612	2110	JW0604	Null

E. coli cannot use citrate as a carbon and energy source for aerobic growth like Klebsiella does (Koser, 1924). Citrate can be catabolized during anaerobic growth in the presence of an oxidizable co-substrate such as glucose, lactose or glycerol; the co-substrate provides needed reducing power (Lütgens, 1980). Aerobic utilization of citrate is blocked by low CitT transporter expression, which can be overcome using a plasmid-encoded transporter (Pos, 1998). In addition to inducing the cit operon and citAB, adding citrate to anaerobic cultures up-regulates the mdh gene needed to convert the oxoaloacetate product to malate (Yamamoto, 2008). The cytoplasmic transmitter domain of autophosphorylated CitA transphosphorylates the CitB receiver domain, causing the CitB DNA-binding output HTH domain to bind to the citCDEFXGT-citAB divergent promoter region and activate transcription of both operons; the reduction of CitA Cys529 is essential for autophosphorylation, perhaps acting as an oxygen-sensing inhibition mechanism restricting cit gene expression to the anaerobic growth conditions that enable citrate-glucose co-fermentation (Yamamoto, 2008; Yamamoto, 2009). CitAB(DpiBA) has been reported to be involved in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance; the citC-T and citAB(dpiBA) operons are induced by beta-lactam treatment and by shifting an ftsI(ts) strain to the non-permissive temperature, in a citB(dpiA)-independent mechanism; both treatments also induce the lexA-, recA-dependent SOS response, dependent upon the citB(dpiA) induction, and lexA or recA mutants block the SOS-dependent antibiotic-induced induction of the cit genes; the antibiotic MICs are not affected by citA or citB mutations; the plating efficiency of a citB(dpiA) mutant is reduced 10-fold as compared to wildtype cells after overnight antibiotic exposure in liquid cultures (Miller, 2004). Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance, but has no effect on beta-lactam resistance (Hirakawa, 2003a; Hirakawa, 2003b).	1786830	P77231	b0613	2114	JW0605	Null

Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance, but has no effect on beta-lactam resistance (Hirakawa, 2003a; Hirakawa, 2003b). Deletion of citAB(dpiBA) did not change the sensitivity to 240 antibiotics and other growth inhibitors; likewise phenotypes were unaltered in ~1000 other assays such as various carbon and nitrogen source utilizations; the anaerobic utilization of citrate was not tested (Zhou, 2003). In vivo overproduced CitAB(DpiBA) stimulates the citC promoter and represses the appY promoter (Ingmar, 1998). Among other functions, the global transcriptional regulator AppY stimulates expression of the anaerobically-induced energy metabolism operons hyaA-F and cbdABX-appA (Brøndsted, 1996; Atlung, 1996; Atlung, 1997). Overproduced CitA(DpiB) destabilizes pSC101 (and other) plasmid inheritance, hence the synonyms dpiAB, and induces the SOS repsonse, acting by CitB(DpiA) binding to the AT-rich plasmid ori region and the chromosomal origin, respectively; citAB(dpiBA) mutants have no effect on plasmid inheritance (Ingmer, 1998; Miller, 2003).

YajO does not have glyoxal or glycolaldehyde reductase activity and a yajO deletion does not increase sensitivity to glyoxal, glycolaldehyde or methylglyoxal (Lee, 2013). Using a mutant strain that accumulates toxic levels of methylglyoxal, it was observed that a yajO deletion strain has a 40% higher level of methylgloxal catabolites (acetol and 1,2-PDO) than a yajO+ strain, although the reason for this elevated catabolite level is not known (Ko, 2005).

Citrate can be catabolized during anaerobic growth in the presence of an oxidizable co-substrate such as glucose, lactose or glycerol; the co-substrate provides needed reducing power (Lütgens, 1980). Aerobic utilization of citrate is blocked by low CitT transporter expression, which can be overcome using a plasmid-encoded transporter (Pos, 1998). In addition to inducing the cit operon and citAB, adding citrate to anaerobic cultures up-regulates the mdh gene needed to convert the oxoaloacetate product to malate (Yamamoto, 2008). The cytoplasmic transmitter domain of autophosphorylated CitA transphosphorylates the CitB receiver domain, causing the CitB DNA-binding output HTH domain to bind to the citCDEFXGT-citAB divergent promoter region and activate transcription of both operons; the reduction of CitA Cys529 is essential for autophosphorylation, perhaps acting as an oxygen-sensing inhibition mechanism restricting cit gene expression to the anaerobic growth conditions that enable citrate-glucose co-fermentation (Yamamoto, 2008; Yamamoto, 2009). CitAB(DpiBA) has been reported to be involved in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance; the citC-T and citAB(dpiBA) operons are induced by beta-lactam treatment and by shifting an ftsI(ts) strain to the non-permissive temperature, in a citB(dpiA)-independent mechanism; both treatments also induce the lexA-, recA-dependent SOS response, dependent upon the citB(dpiA) induction, and lexA or recA mutants block the SOS-dependent antibiotic-induced induction of the cit genes; the antibiotic MICs are not affected by citA or citB mutations; the plating efficiency of a citB(dpiA) mutant is reduced 10-fold as compared to wildtype cells after overnight antibiotic exposure in liquid cultures (Miller, 2004). Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance, but has no effect on beta-lactam resistance (Hirakawa, 2003a; Hirakawa, 2003b).	87081765	P77390	b0618	2126	JW0610	Null

Plasmid-based overexpression of CitB(DpiA) increases fosfomycin resistance, but has no effect on beta-lactam resistance (Hirakawa, 2003a; Hirakawa, 2003b). Deletion of citAB(dpiBA) did not change the sensitivity to 240 antibiotics and other growth inhibitors; likewise phenotypes were unaltered in ~1000 other assays such as various carbon and nitrogen source utilizations; the anaerobic utilization of citrate was not tested (Zhou, 2003). In vivo overproduced CitAB(DpiBA) stimulates the citC promoter and represses the appY promoter (Ingmar, 1998). Among other functions, the global transcriptional regulator AppY stimulates expression of the anaerobically-induced energy metabolism operons hyaA-F and cbdABX-appA (Brøndsted, 1996; Atlung, 1996; Atlung, 1997). Overproduced CitA(DpiB) destabilizes pSC101 (and other) plasmid inheritance, hence the synonyms dpiAB, and induces the SOS repsonse, acting by CitB(DpiA) binding to the AT-rich plasmid ori region and the chromosomal origin, respectively; citAB(dpiBA) mutants have no effect on plasmid inheritance (Ingmer, 1998; Miller, 2003). The citA(criR) gene was identified as a transcriptional regulator of the ipa pathogenicity island in Shigella flexneri, but E. coli K-12 does not have the ipa genes (Qi, 1996; Walker, 2002). ChiX(RybC,MicM) regulates citAB(dpiBA) mRNA; citAB(dpiBA) mRNA may be a ChiX trap-mRNA (also called an RNA decoy) (Mandin, 2009).	; 1786837	P77510	b0619	2129	JW0611	CG18469

No predicted periplasmic binding protein is associated with this predicted ABC transporter YbhGFSR, suggesting that it is an exporter, which is consistent with the presence of a membrane fusion protein (YbhG) allowing for export transit across the periplasm.

A ybjN mutant appears to be upregulated for fimbriae, flagella, motility, capsule and biofilm production; overproduction of YbjN slows growth, induces toxin-antitoxin modules, causes autoaggregation, reduces motility, reduces biofilm formation, increases acid sensitivity, down-regulates gadA, gadB and gadE, and down-regulates fimbriae production; ybjN is optimally expressed in exponential phase cells at 28C; the coa(Ts) mutant ts19 has 10-fold less ybjN mRNA than a coa+ strain which may be related to its ability to suppress coa(Ts) although a ybjN mutant is not itself temperature sensitive (Wang, 2011). Constitutive expression of cloned marA in a marR mutant increases ybjN transcription 3-fold (Barbosa, 2000). YbjN over-expression suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of coa(Ts) mutants including ts19; YbjN may have chaperone-like properties (Chen, 2006). YbjN is the founding member of a superfamily (Pfam PF10722) that includes DR1245, a Deinococcus radiodurans protein that is a binding partner of the DNA damage response single-stranded DNA-binding protein DdrB; DdrB, but not DR1245, is upregulated after ionizing radiation and is required for survival after a high dose of ionizing radiation; mutants lacking DR1245, but not mutants lacking DdrB, have a slow growth phenotype; it was suggested that DR1245 might be a chaperone (Norais, 2013). YbjN family members identified using blastp are limited to the enterobacteria but YbjN superfamily members as identified with significant matches to Pfam PF10722 are more widespread; the YbjN superfamily is grouped into the same structural similarity clan (Pfam CL0097) as two type III secretion chaperone familes represented by Pfam PF07824 (SigE family) and PF05932 (CesT family) (Luo, 2001; Norais, 2013).

ATP-binding stabilizes YncE (Liu, 2011). YncE is a SecB-dependent secreted periplasmic protein that accumulates in the cytoplasm as an uncleaved precursor in a secB mutant (Baars, 2006). The beta-propellar structure of YncE may have led to a false prediction of YncE as a beta-barrel outer membrane protein (Zhai, 2002). YncE has a seven-bladed beta-propellar structure; YncE binds ssDNA better than dsDNA (Kagawa, 2011). Other beta-propellar WD40 repeat proteins include heme-binding oxidoreductases which may have led to a unsupported prediction that YncE is an oxidoreductase. YncE binds ATP and ssDNA, both of which are in short supply in the periplasm, making a functional prediction difficult; YncE has been suggested to be involved in iron transport since yncE is adjacent to the fhuA paralog yncD; perhaps YncE is a periplasmic binding protein facilitating the uptake of a novel iron ferrichrome that resembles ATP and ssDNA and that the binding of ATP and ssDNA is not physiologically relavent. ArcA binds in the yncE-yncD divergent promoter region and ArcA represses yncE and yncD expression (Federowicz, 2014).	1787724	P76116	b1452	4843	JW1447	Null

Contrary to previous reports of a DosP tetramer (based on gel filtration), full-length DosP is a dimer in solution (Lechauve, 2009). Redox changes in the bound heme result in global 3D structural alterations; this "scissor-type" subunit movement aids in catalytic control. DosP contains 2 N-terminal heme binding PAS domains, a central defective GGDEF domain, and a C-terminal EAL domain. The start codon might be 8 codons upstream. dosP expression is elevated under aerobic conditions where it is partially responsible for cAMP degradation. The heme binding domain has been referred to as DosH. Asp40 of DosP is involved in the electronic structure of the haem iron and redox-dependent catalytic control of the PDE domain because mutations in Asp40 result in lack of catalytic activity. A dosP mutant is reported to have elevated cAMP under aerobic conditions, but this may be an indirect effect or it may reflect a physiologically relevant cAMP PDE activity in vivo. dosCP is an operon and DosCP is a protein complex (Tuckerman, 2009). 	; 87081921	P76129	b1489	4963	JW1484	CG63097

DosCP may constitute a cyclic-di-GMP synthesis/degradation module (Mendez-Ortiz, 2006; Tuckerman, 2009). Overexpression of DosC(YddV), but not other DGCs, up-regulates the pgaABCD operon and biofilm formation independently of CsrA, and a dosC(yddV) mutant has reduced pgaABCD expression (Tagliabue, 2010b). Overexpressed DosC(YddV) complements R. leguminosarum celR mutants to produce cellulose and enhances cellulose production in A. tumefaciens. DosC(YddV) can complement Salmonella adrA. DosC(YddV) has an N-terminal GCSD(Globin-Coupled-Sensor Domain) that binds oxygen (Tuckerman, 2009). DosC(YddV) has a C-terminal diguanylate cyclase GGDEF domain. dosCP is an operon and DosCP is a protein complex (Tuckerman, 2009).

The Salmonella PF01042 family member RidA(YjgF) is an enamine/imine deaminase required in vivo for the detoxification of reactive intermediates of the PLP-dependent threonine/serine dehydratase IlvA, releasing ammonia in a hydrolysis reaction indicative of the low water environment of the cell; RutC has weak enamine/imine deaminase activity as measured by an increased initial rate of IlvA-catalyzed 2-ketobutyrate formation in vitro using either threonine or serine as substrate; the weak reaction of RutC as compared to other RidA homologs is likely due to relatively low sequence similarity and use of a non-native substrate (Lambrecht, 2012). RidA(YjgF), RutC, TdcF, YoaB and YjgH are paralogs and members of a highly conserved RidA(YjgF) family (pfam:PF01042) with diverse mutant phenotypes; the family members form homotrimers, some binding 2-ketoglutarate or related compounds, and all are probably reactive intermediate deaminases.

The results of Jonas (2008) might indicate that although the c-di-GMP spike inhibits motility it is not known if this is the normal function of the overproduced diguanylate cyclase or if the overexpression induced non-physiological crosstalk. YcdT is homologous to Y. pestis hemin storage gene hmsT, but is unable to complement hmsT mutations. YcdT has been shown not to be a regulator of the divergent pgaABCD operon. Codon usage indicates ycdT is an alien (horizontal) gene. YcdT has an N-terminal integral membrane domain with 8 predicted TM helices reminiscent of the MASE TM signaling domains in other c-di-GMP enzymes.

Three paralogous cls genes encoding cardiolipin synthases, clsA(cls), clsB(ybhO) and clsC(ymdC), need to be deleted in order to prevent in vivo cardiolipin synthesis; most studies on the effects of cardiolipin depletion only used clsA(cls) mutant strains that still sythesize cardiolipin (Tan, 2012).

Overproduced FtsW but not overproduced MurJ increases lipid II translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane in crude reconstituted vesicles (Mohammadi, 2011). Both FtsW and MurJ are involved in lipid II translocation but which one is the actual flippase is controversial with conflicting in vivo and in vitro results; the in vitro results utilize crude membrane vesicles that also contain MurJ, which may not be limiting; the in vivo results do not demonstrate flippase activity directly and FtsW inactivation could be incomplete, so one of the two proteins could be stimulating the other which has the flippase activity; MurJ is related to known flippase exporters and FtsW is not, suggesting that MurJ may indeed be the actual flippase (Young, 2014). murJ(yceN) is an essential gene and conditional lethal mutants swell, burst and accumulate the murein intermediate polyprenyl diphosphate-N-acetylmuramic acid-(pentapeptide)-N-acetyl-glucosamine at the non-permissive temperature (Inoue, 2008). murJ(yceN) was identified as one of two ORFs adjacent to the flg locus in a region originally named mviS, then renamed mviN and mviM when sequenced; mviMN was thought to be required for mouse virulence in Salmonella, but the mviMN deletion in ST39 also removed flgM (Carsiotis, 1989). flgM was later shown to be able to complement the mviS phenotype, and thus flgM is the real mouse virulence gene in this region of the Salmonella chromosome not mviS (Schmitt, 1994).	1787309	P0AF16	b1069	3630	JW1056	Null

However, in contrast to previously published results, a Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 rflP(ydiV,cdgR,STM1344) mutant was found to have a lowered intracellular c-di-GMP and overexpression of rflP(ydiV,cdgR,STM1344) increased intracellular c-di-GMP, which may be attributable to differences in the c-di-GMP assay (soluble lysate vs total cell extraction); Salmonella typhimurium RflP(YdiV) is a single domain EAL protein lacking phosphodiesterase, diguanylate cyclase, or c-di-GMP binding activity; RflP(YdiV,STM1344) is positive regulator of csgD transcription (Simm, 2009). In Salmonella typhimurium laboratory strain LT2 neither a rflP(ydiV) mutation nor overexpression of RflP(YdiV) significantly affected c-di-GMP levels (Wada, 2011). Extracellular AI-1 stimulates rflP(ydiV) RNA expression in an SdiA-dependent manner (Zhou, 2008). An sdiA rflP(ydiV) double mutant has two-fold reduced cAMP levels that inhibit quorum sensing system 2 (Zhou, 2008). rflP(ydiV) RNA is 3.5-fold up-regulated by RpoS at ph 5 (Weber, 2006). The ydiV gene has been renamed as RflP bsed upon its regulation of FlhD4C2 proteolysis in Salmonella typhimurium (Hengge, 2016), A rflP(ydiV) mutation decreases cAMP levels in an sdiA mutant. rflP(ydiV) is a pheromone AI-1-responsive gene.	1788000	P76204	b1707	5696	JW1697	Null

In a purified in vitro system, YnjE increases molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) biosynthesis independent of the YnjE active site cysteine and without enhancing IscS activity, indicating that YnjE is probably a specificity factor recruiting IscS to MoCo synthesis when competing IscS substrates are present, facilitated by YnjE binding to MoeB which then tightens the IscS-MoaD interaction (Dahl, 2011). A ynjE mutant does not have reduced MoCo synthesis when grown in LB in iscS+ strains, but a ynjE mutation does reduce the residual MoCo present in in iscS mutant; the IscS specificty function of YnjE may not be needed during growth in LB; in the absence of IscS YnjE may be able to compensate by direct transpersulfidation of MoaD in vivo (Dahl, 2011). The sulfurtransferase IscS transfers sulfur to the active site Cys of YnjE in vitro forming a persulfide (Hänzelmann, 2009). An iscS mutant has reduced YnjE sulfuration indicating that IscS can form a YnjE persulfide in vivo (Dahl, 2011). YnjE has weak in vitro thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity and does not have detectable 3-mercaptopyruvate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity (Hänzelmann, 2009). YnjE has three rhodanese domains. YnjE has an ambiguous signal prediction: the first 17 aa are predicted to be a type II signal peptide; the first 23 aa are predicted to be a type I signal peptide; YnjE is homologous to proteins with strong type II predictions; this may reflect signal type II to I evolution. YnjE has found to have a dual localization, being present in both the cytoplasm and the periplasm; no evidence for a membrane attachment was found (Dahl, 2011). The ambiguous signal peptide prediction for YnjE may indicate that the YnjE is poorly cleaved and secreted, leaving some protein in the cytoplasm and exporting some to the periplasm. The ynjE promoter region binds FNR and ynjE expression is activated by FNR (Federowicz, 2014).	87081967	P78067	b1757	5848	JW5287	Null

KDG is derived from pectin, a common plant heteropolysaccharide, although E. coli K-12 does not secrete pectinases or uptake pectin oligosaccharides and has only the core KDG regulon as compared to plant pathogens like Erwinia chrysanthemi, whose extracellular pectate lyases and intacellular oligogalacturonate lyase breaks pectin down mainly into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) monomers and to a lesser extent polygalacturonase-generated galacturonate; in E. coli K-12 galacturonate uptake and degradation is mediated by the ExuT permease and the UxaABC catabolic enzymes producing KDG, respectively, and DKI is imported by the KdgR-regulated KDG importer KdgT and catabolized to KDG by the KdgR-regulated KduID enyzymes, also producing KDG; KDG is converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by KdsK and Eda(KdsA) (Rodionov, 2004; Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, 1996). A kdgR-yebQ clone conferred hypersensitivity to trimethoprim, but a yebQ-alone expression clone did not, leading the authors to conclude that overexpression of the transcriptional regulator KdgR was responsible for the Acr-S phenoptype. 2/360 KdgR peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is removed (Maillet, 2007).	; 1788131	P76268	b1827	6081	JW1816	CG590

Two alternatives were proposed for the synthesis of cmo5U from ho5U in E. coli including the direct conversion by a carboxymethyltransferase (referred to as an acetylase) and a two-step reaction with mo5U as an intermediate; mo5U34 is present in the U wobble base of tRNAs from B. subtilis (Murao, 1978). CmoA, a member of the methyltrasferase superfamily, was previously thought to be involved in the chorismate-dependent conversion of mo5U34 to cmo5U34 in tRNA as both ho5U and mo5U accumulated in a cmoA mutant and in an aroD mutant, although a mechanism was not apparent; CmoB was previously thought to be responsible for the conversion of ho5U to mo5U since only ho5U accumulated in a cmoB mutants (Nasvall, 2004). Now it seems, since mo5U is not an intermediate in (m)cmo5U synthesis, that CmoB might utilize SAM inefficiently in the absence of CmoA-generated carboxy-SAM to form mo5U. Carboxy-SAM (Cx-SAM), also called S-adenosyl-S-carboxymethyl-l-homocysteine (SCM-SAH), was identified in crystal structures of E. coli and H. influenzae CmoA (Kim, 2013; Byrne, 2013). otherPDB (H. influenzae): 1IM8 (Lim, 2001). 4/128 CmoA(YecO) peptide masses from MS analysis confirm this start codon and indicate that the initial Met is not removed (Maillet, 2007). CmoA peptide masses from MS/MS analysis indicate this is the correct start site and that the initial Met is removed (Guo, 2014).	1788177	P76290	b1870	6237	JW1859	Null

Two alternatives were proposed for the synthesis of cmo5U from ho5U in E. coli including the direct conversion by an acetylase (actually a carboxymethyltransferase) and a two-step reaction with mo5U as an intermediate; mo5U34 is present in the U wobble base of tRNAs from B. subtilis (Murao, 1978). In S. typhimurium, CmoA, a member of the methyltransferase superfamily, was previously thought to be involved in the chorismate-dependent conversion of mo5U34 to cmo5U34 in tRNA as both ho5U and mo5U accumulated in a cmoA mutant and in an aroD mutant, although a mechanism was not apparent; CmoB was previously thought to be responsible for the conversion of ho5U to mo5U since only ho5U accumulated in a cmoB mutants (Nasvall, 2004). Now it seems from work done in E. coli, that since mo5U is not an intermediate in (m)cmo5U synthesis, CmoB might utilize SAM inefficiently in the absence of CmoA-generated carboxy-SAM to form mo5U from ho5U. It is also possible that mcmo5U is made from cmo5U by CmoB utilizing SAM instead of carboxy-SAM.	1788178	P76291	b1871	6241	JW1860	Null

The E. coli K-12 genome does not encode an OHCU decarboxylase (COG3195) homolog. E. coli can convert xanthine to allantoin, although less efficiently than K. pneumoniae; HiuH(YedX) might participate in purine catabolism by helping to degrade the uric acid produced by xanthine dehydrogenase (Xi, 2000). It has been suggested that the lack of uricase enzyme activity might be partially compensated for by a spontaneous reaction of uric acid acting as an antioxidant in the periplasm resulting in a non-enzymatic production of 5-hydroxyisourate and that HiuH might protect from free radicals (Hennebry, 2006). The HIUHase family has a C -terminal YRGS conserved motif. Purified E. coli HiuH(YedX) can be induced to form fibrils with stirring or heat (Santos, 2008; Lundberg, 2009).

Seven E. coli proteins, RcsB, RutR, McbR, RpsD, MltD, YcjR, and YbaB, were found to be Salmonella Pat(YfiQ) substrates modifiable by lysine acetylation in vitro using protein chips (Thao, 2010). RcsB is acetylated at Lys180 by purified E. coli Pka(YfiQ) in vitro, blocking its ability to bind to DNA, and Lys180 is deacetylated by CobB in vitro (Thao, 2010). pka(yfiQ) was named pat for protein acetyltransferase in Salmonella where it inhibits acetyl CoA synthase Acs by acetylating residue K609 (Starai, 2004). Acetyl CoA synthase (Acs) is activated by sirtuin homolog CobB-mediated deacetylation of K609 in Salmonella (Starai, 2002). More than 100 proteins have acetylated lysines in E. coli (Yu, 2008; Zhang, 2008). CobB is likely to have a limited role in general protein lysine deacetylation since only four protein bands were changed in an E. coli cobB mutant (Zhang, 2008). A deletion of pka(yfiQ) did not prevent general protein lysine acetylation of the human chemokine RANTES when cloning in E. coli BL(21); instead, non-enzymatic lysine acetylation of isolated RANTES inclusion bodies by acetyl-CoA was demonstrated and non-enzymatic processes may also be responsible for general lysine acetylation of proteins in E. coli (d'Alayer, 2007). RNase R (Rnr) is de-stabilized by proteolysis in exponential phase relative to stationary phase due to Pka-mediated acetylation of Rnr Lys544 in exponential phase only (Liang, 2011).	1788938	P76594	b2584	8506	JW2568	Null

A yfiR deletion abolishes swarming motility with only a slight effect on swimming and suppresses the swimming motility defect of yhjH mutations (Girgis, 2007). The first 22 aa of YfiR are predicted to be a type I signal peptide. The P. aeruginosa ortholog DgcN(YfiN) is an inner membrane-associated diguanylate cyclase whose activity is negatively regulated by the P. aeruginosa periplasmic protein YfiR; the P. aeruginosa OM lipoprotein YfiB counteracts YfiR inhibition of DgcN(YfiN) (Malone, 2010).

An ORF antisense to yaaW, referred to as htgA or htpY, has been described as having a high temperature survival function and as being subject to heat-induced gene expression (Dean, 1991; James, 1993; Missiakas, 1993). Evidence supporting the expression of the putative antisense ORF htgA(htpY) in vivo has been presented, although this has never been reproduced (Missiakas, 1993). A yaaW/htgA deletion mutant displays 3-fold increased biofilm production (Domka, 2007). Although there may be an asRNA on the opposite strand of yaaW (asRNA-yaaW), its functional relevance should not be assumed. A comprehensive characterization of the E. coli K-12 heat shock response found no evidence supporting heat shock-induction or RpoH-dependent in vitro transcription of the proposed htgA(htpY) gene (Nonaka, 2006). The antisense ORF opposing yaaW is not conserved and has an unusual amino acid composition. Long antisense ORFs occur often in the E. coli K-12 genome and are not considered to be likely protein-coding genes (Borodovsky, 1994). Skepticism is warranted when predicting long overlapping protein-coding genes in the E. coli K-12 genome as not a single case has yet been proven; actual translation should be experimentally demonstrated unequivocally. GFP transcriptional fusions to both yaaW and asRNA-yaaW were active; 5'-RACE was used to map the yaaW and asRNA-yaaW transcription start points (Fellner, 2013). The asRNA-yaaW ORF was proposed to be a functional protein-coding gene, but attempts to demonstrate production of an asRNA-encoded protein failed (Fellner, 2013). Nonsense mutations were specifically introduced, but not DNA sequence-confirmed, into the asRNA-yaaW ORF (referred to as mbiA) and yaaW in a manner preserving the amino acid sequences encoded in the opposite strand; slightly increased biofilm production was reported for both mutants, however no nonsense suppression or trans-complementation experiments were described, leaving reasonable doubt about the conclusion that the asRNA-yaaW ORF encodes a protein product (Fellner, 2013). yaaW-asRNA transcription has been detected in various microarray studies and appears to be subject to transcriptional regulation different than that of yaaW, but microarray data does not provide evidence for the translation of mbiA into a protein. A conclusive experimental demonstration of asRNA-yaaW translation has not yet been published that would warrant annotating the putative asRNA-YaaW ORF as a functional protein-coding gene.	; 1786193	P75617	b0011	37	JW0010	CG30233

Toxin endoribonuclease MqsR degrades ghoS antitoxin mRNA but not ghoT toxin mRNA, amplifying the GhoT toxin production as a stress response (Wang, 2013). MqsR induction increases GhoT production; GhoT is localized to poles and does not cause cell lysis during normal physiology but does impair membrane function, causing a reduction of cellular ATP and PMF energy sources, a lowered metabolism, and an increase in the number of persistent (dormant) cells formed in the presence of antibiotics (Cheng, 2013).	87082373	P64646	b4559	Null	JW5732	Null

A ~400 bp LexA-regulated mRNA covering tisB has been observed in Northern blots (De Henestrosa et al, 2000). lstR-1 mediates antisense inhibition of TisB translation and this inhibition may be mitigated during the SOS response by the the istR-2 sRNA which has a LexA-regulated promoter upstream of the IstR-1 promoter (Vogel, 2004). The antisense sRNA IstR-1 binds to and blocks an upstream ribosome loading standby site required for translation initiation of TisB; ribosomes probably slide to the highly structured downstream TIR after loading; this results in RNase III cleavage of the active, processed +42 tisB mRNA to form an inactive +106 tisB mRNA (Darfeuille, 2007). Overexpression of tisB mRNA inhibits the SOS response including UV sensitivity and a delayed induction of recA; TisB toxin is implicated by two internal sense-to-nonsense mutations that cause premature translation termination and abolish the SOS inhibition, however a start codon mutation with normal amounts of tisB RNA does not block the effect, indicating that the TisB toxin may not be the effector; the unprocessed tisB pre-mRNA functions as an antisense RNA regulator of uxaA, resulting in cleavage of uxaA mRNA at the antisense site and also reciprocal cleavage and activation of the tisB pre-mRNA (forming the +42 tisB RNA); the tisB pre-RNA probably regulates dinD translation also; the tisB SOS defect is dependent on the presence of the uxaA antisense target and the dinD putative antisense target (Weel-Sneve, 2008). Although plasmid mutations indicate TisB is expressible, chromosomal expression has not been detected. The internal stop codon TisB mutations may block the SOS inhibition by reducing the amount of tisB pre-RNA present (which was not measured) and that the pre-RNA antisense regulation is solely responsible for the SOS inhibition, possibly explaining the discrepancy between the SOS inhibition phenotypes of the start codon mutation and the internal stop mutations observed by Weel-Sneve, 2008. TisB is conserved in Salmonella, but the previously annotated protein TisA is not conserved; tisA is not translated. Mutating the TisB translation start site blocks the toxic effect (Vogel, 2004). Previously tisA(ysdA) and tisB(ysdB) were fused into one hypothetical ORF by frameshift reconstruction, but this region was resequenced by De Henestrosa et al, 2000, who confirm the sequence is correct, so two separate ORFs were reinstated, but tisA has now been removed as a dubious annotation.	145693200	A5A627	b4618	Null	Null	Null

B7L4V9 is 505 aa and starts at an ATG 4 codons upstream, but this upstream start codon has no RBS associated with it. The C-terminal domain of full-length YzgL belongs to the PstS superfamily of solute binding domains found in both periplasmic binding proteins and in LysR family transcriptional regulators. The N-terminal domain of full-length YzgL has no CDD hits with E values < 0.01, but the two best hits suggest that the N-terminal domain is not a DNA-binding domain, but rather the permease component of a transport system, possibly an ion transporter. These CDD (at NCBI) hits are to (1) COG2998 (TupB), weakly predicting (E = 0.02) that this domain is related to the permease component of an ABC-type tungstate transport system, and (2) COG3263, weakly predicting (E = 0.10) that this domain is related to NhaP-type Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiporters. Full-length YzgL may be a hydrid transporter with an N-terminal integral membrane domain and a C-terminal periplasmic solute-binding domain. Consistent with this interpretation, TMHMM predicts five transmembrane segments (TMs) in the first 203 residues and no TMs in the C-terminal 300 residues, whci is predicted by TMHMM to be outside (periplasmic). Signal-P HMM predicts a 22 signal peptide, but this may be a false positive due to an N-terminal transmembrane region.

However an RNA transcript complementary to glnU detectable only in an RNase P deficient strain was found using microarrays and confirmed with a Northern blot (Li, 2003). The nature, length, and start site of this b0669 transcript is not known: it may be a novel sRNA, it may encode a small protein, it may be a ubiF readthrough transcript, or it might represent a spurious non-physiological transcription event due to the rpesence of an accidental promoter.

The intB' pseudogene is adjacent to the leuX tRNA gene and may be the remnant of P2-like phage integration at leuX and subsequent loss. The region from leuX to yjhQ gene was once designated as prophage KpLE2 (Hayashi, 2001). Although this region contains several IS elements, it has no other phage gene homologs and has many core genes, and thus is unlikely to represent a prophage region; therefore all references to the KpLE2 prophage have been removed. The region clockwise from leuX through intB' has been designated as the PR-X prophage remnant and described as P2-like and highly deleted, although no length or right end was indicated (Casjens, 2003). PR-X has not been annotated as a defective prophage because it appears to be limited to one pseudogene, intB' and the leuX-intB' intergenic region.	Null	Null	b4270	13986	JWR0115	CG561

A frameshift mutation caused by a one base pair deletion in codon 285 was hypothetically corrected by translating codon 285 as X instead of the H that was probably there prior to the one base pair deletion event; frame is preserved in the gene reconstruction by repeating the nucleotide prior to the deleted nucleotide. The annotated start site was verified for a wildtype IS911. The last seven residues of ORFB are polymorphic; the C-terminal residues of this reconstructed ORFAB from K-12 matches the C-terminus of ORFB from UniProtKB M9F4Q3. Fused versions of ORFAB include UniProtKB Q6Q6S9 and Q8GJ19, but with different C-terminal residues than K-12.	Null	P75680	b4623	Null	Null	Null

The folP mutants in the Keio collection have been shown to harbor an intact copy of folP in addition to the deletion allele (Yamamoto, 2009). The merodiploid folP duplication in the Keio mutants strains probably compensates for the lack of supplemental folate in the LB rich medium utilized to construct the folP mutants.	; 87082224	P0AC13	b3177	10441	JW3144	CG29566
