FUNCTION: Catalyzes the attachment of isoleucine to tRNA(Ile). As IleRS can inadvertently accommodate and process structurally similar amino acids such as valine, to avoid such errors it has two additional distinct tRNA(Ile)-dependent editing activities. One activity is designated as 'pretransfer' editing and involves the hydrolysis of activated Val-AMP. The other activity is designated 'posttransfer' editing and involves deacylation of mischarged Val-tRNA(Ile).	5 out of 5	Binding site (2); Chain (1); Initiator methionine (1); Metal binding (4); Modified residue (1); Motif (2); Mutagenesis (15); Natural variant (1); Sequence conflict (10)	MISCELLANEOUS: Strain PS102 is resistant to the antibiotic mupirocin (pseudomonic acid A), an Ile-analog that competitively inhibits activation by Ile-tRNA synthetase, thus inhibiting protein biosynthesis.

May compensate for the lack of Cys-tRNA(Pro) editing by ProRS. Is also able to deacylate Cys-tRNA(Cys), and displays weak deacylase activity in vitro against Gly-tRNA(Gly), as well as, at higher concentrations, some other correctly charged tRNAs. Unlike some of its orthologs it is not able to remove the amino acid moiety from incorrectly charged Ala-tRNA(Pro). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15886196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23185990}.	4 out of 5	Beta strand (10); Chain (1); Helix (6); Mutagenesis (2); Site (1); Turn (1)	MISCELLANEOUS: Has been suggested to be potentially involved in suppression of transcription of ushA.; MISCELLANEOUS: Reaction mechanism involves exclusion of catalytic water from the active site and substrate-mediated catalysis: the sulfhydryl side chain of the Cys substrate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl center of the ester bond, leading to the cleavage of the Cys-tRNA ester bond and formation of a cyclic cysteine thiolactone intermediate. In contrast, the INS editing domain of ProRS catalyzes Ala-tRNA(Pro) hydrolysis via nucleophilic attack by a catalytic water molecule (PubMed:23185990). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:23185990}.

FUNCTION: Folding helper with both chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activities. Chaperone activity prevents aggregation of unfolded or partially folded proteins and promotes their correct folding. PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of Xaa-Pro bonds of peptides, which accelerates slow steps of protein folding and thus shortens the lifetime of intermediates. Both strategies lower the concentration of intermediates and increase the productivity and yield of the folding reaction. SlyD could be involved in Tat-dependent translocation, by binding to the Tat-type signal of folded proteins. The PPIase substrate specificity, carried out with synthetic peptides of the 'suc-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Phe-4NA' type (where Xaa is the AA tested), was found to be Phe > Ala > Leu.; FUNCTION: Required for lysis of phiX174 infected cells by stabilizing the hydrophobic viral lysis protein E and allowing it to accumulate to the levels required to exert its lytic effect. May act by a chaperone-like mechanism.; FUNCTION: Also involved in hydrogenase metallocenter assembly, probably by participating in the nickel insertion step. This function in hydrogenase biosynthesis requires chaperone activity and the presence of the metal-binding domain, but not PPIase activity.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (14); Chain (1); Compositional bias (3); Domain (1); Helix (3); Metal binding (6); Mutagenesis (4); Region (4); Turn (2)	MISCELLANEOUS: The activity of SlyD is considerably smaller than the one found in other PPIases with the same substrate.

Participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured proteins and by disaggregating proteins, also in an autonomous, DnaK-independent fashion. Unfolded proteins bind initially to DnaJ; upon interaction with the DnaJ-bound protein, DnaK hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting in the formation of a stable complex. GrpE releases ADP from DnaK; ATP binding to DnaK triggers the release of the substrate protein, thus completing the reaction cycle. Several rounds of ATP-dependent interactions between DnaJ, DnaK and GrpE are required for fully efficient folding. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15302880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15485812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1826368}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (8); Chain (1); Compositional bias (1); Domain (1); Helix (5); Initiator methionine (1); Metal binding (8); Mutagenesis (38); Repeat (4); Turn (11); Zinc finger (1)

Binds to the 70S ribosome E site where it modulates the state of the translating ribosome during subunit translocation. Stimulates dipeptide bond synthesis in the presence of ATP (cell in high energy state), but inhibits dipeptide synthesis in the presence of ADP (cell in low energy state), and thus may control translation in response to changing ATP levels (including during stationary phase). Following ATP hydrolysis is probably released allowing the ribosome to enter the elongation phase. Its specificity for the IC may be conferred by its recognition of features unique to tRNA(fMet). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24389465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24389466}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (22); Chain (1); Domain (2); Frameshift (2); Helix (22); Initiator methionine (1); Mutagenesis (2); Nucleotide binding (2); Region (2); Turn (5)	
P0A832	smpB	smqB	b2620 JW2601	SsrA-binding protein (Small protein B)			FUNCTION: Required for rescue of stalled ribosomes mediated by trans-translation. Binds to tmRNA RNA (also known as SsrA or 10Sa RNA, 363 nucleotides in this organism), required for stable binding of tmRNA to ribosomes (PubMed:10393194, PubMed:11904185, PubMed:11917023). tmRNA and SmpB together mimic tRNA shape, replacing the anticodon stem-loop with SmpB (Probable). tmRNA is encoded by the ssrA gene; the 2 termini fold to resemble tRNA(Ala) and it encodes a 'tag peptide', a short internal open reading frame. Able to recruit charged tmRNA to ribosomes (PubMed:15069072). Does not play a role in transcription, processing or Ala-aminoacylation of tmRNA (PubMed:10393194). Other studies have shown it stimulates aminoacylation of tmRNA (PubMed:11917023, PubMed:11904185). May protect tmRNA from degradation (PubMed:11917023). Binds to tmRNA that cannot be aminoacylated (tmRNA G3A), does not bind to tmRNA mutations near the tRNA-like termini (tmRNA G19C, A334U); other tmRNA mutations that block trans-translation still bind SmpB (PubMed:11917023). With tmRNA may play a role in bacterial persistence (PubMed:23812681). During trans-translation Ala-aminoacylated transfer-messenger RNA acts like a tRNA, entering the A-site of stalled ribosomes, displacing the stalled mRNA. The ribosome then switches to translate the ORF on the tmRNA, the nascent peptide is terminated with the 'tag peptide' encoded by the tmRNA and targeted for degradation.

The arfA mRNA is cleaved by ribonuclease 3 within a hairpin structure, probably immediately after the Gly-55 codon, which produces a truncated non-stop transcript and leads to ribosome arrest. In the presence of SsrA, the stalled ribosome is rescued and the incomplete nascent ArfA is tagged for degradation. In the absence of SsrA, truncated ArfA chains are released from the ribosome and are functional.

Crystallization with T.thermophilus 70S ribosomes shows it binds in the channel between the head and body of the 30S subunit, where mRNA, tRNAs, initiation factors IF1 and IF3 and elongation factor G would bind; however RMF is still able to bind (PubMed:22605777). In this crystal binding of HPF induces movement of the 30S head domain away from the rest of the ribosome, presumably so they would more easily form dimers (PubMed:22605777).

P64594	yhaV		b3130 JW3099	Toxin YhaV (EC 3.1.-.-) (Ribonuclease YhaV)	3.1.-.-		FUNCTION: Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Has RNase activity in vitro. Overexpression leads to growth arrest after 30 minutes; these effects are overcome by concomitant expression of antitoxin SohA (PrlF). Massive overexpression is toxic. Unlike most other characterized TA systems degrades rRNA, and co-folding of the proteins is necessary in vitro for inhibition of the RNase activity. It is not known if it has any sequence-specificity. Acts as a transcription factor. The YhaV/PrlF complex binds the prlF-yhaV operon, probably negatively regulating its expression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17706670}.	4 out of 5	Chain (1); Mutagenesis (3)

Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming PreQ1, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product. After dissociation, two additional enzymatic reactions on the tRNA convert PreQ1 to queuine (Q), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00168, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11714265, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12909636}.	5 out of 5	Active site (2); Binding site (3); Chain (1); Metal binding (4); Mutagenesis (16); Region (3); Sequence conflict (2)

In details, the methyl group from one SAM molecule is initially transferred to Cys-355 in a typical SN2 displacement. Then a 5'-dA radical formed from a second molecule of SAM abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group of mCys-355, and the resulting Cys-appended methyl radical attacks the substrate adenine ring. Methyl transfer to C2 thus results in a covalent adduct between the substrate and Cys-355, which is resolved by formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-355 and a second conserved Cys residue (Cys-118).

This makes better substrates for topoisomerase 4 (ParC and ParE) which is the main enzyme that unlinks newly replicated chromosomes in E.coli (PubMed:9334322). Gyrase catalyzes the interconversion of other topological isomers of double-stranded DNA rings, including catenanes (PubMed:22457352). Relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA in an ATP-independent manner (PubMed:337300). E.coli gyrase has higher supercoiling activity than other characterized bacterial gyrases; at comparable concentrations E.coli gyrase introduces more supercoils faster than M.tuberculosis gyrase, while M.tuberculosis gyrase has higher decatenation than supercoiling activity compared to E.coli (PubMed:22457352). E.coli makes 15% more negative supercoils in pBR322 plasmid DNA than S.typhimurium; the S.typhimurium GyrB subunit is toxic in E.coli, while the E.coli copy can be expressed in S.typhimurium even though the 2 subunits have 777/804 residues identical (PubMed:17400739).

FUNCTION: A type II topoisomerase that negatively supercoils closed circular double-stranded (ds) DNA in an ATP-dependent manner to maintain chromosomes in an underwound state (PubMed:3031051, PubMed:186775, PubMed:7811004, PubMed:9148951, PubMed:12051842, PubMed:18642932, PubMed:19060136, PubMed:20356737, PubMed:22457353, PubMed:23294697, PubMed:19965760). This makes better substrates for topoisomerase IV (ParC and ParE) which is the main enzyme that unlinks newly replicated chromosomes in E.coli (PubMed:9334322). Gyrase catalyzes the interconversion of other topological isomers of dsDNA rings, including catenanes (PubMed:22457352). Relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA in an ATP-independent manner (PubMed:337300). E.coli gyrase has higher supercoiling activity than many other bacterial gyrases; at comparable concentrations E.coli gyrase introduces more supercoils faster than M.tuberculosis gyrase, while M.tuberculosis gyrase has higher decatenation than supercoiling activity compared to E.coli (PubMed:22457352). E.coli makes 15% more negative supercoils in pBR322 plasmid DNA than S.typhimurium; the S.typhimurium GyrB subunit is toxic in E.coli, while the E.coli copy can be expressed in S.typhimurium even though the 2 subunits have 777/804 residues identical (PubMed:17400739). The enzymatic differences between E.coli gyrase and topoisomerase IV are largely due to the GyrA C-terminal domain (approximately residues 524-841) and specifically the GyrA-box (PubMed:8962066, PubMed:16332690). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12051842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16332690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17400739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18642932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19060136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20356737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22457352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22457353, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23294697, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3031051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:337300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7811004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8962066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9148951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9334322}.; FUNCTION: Negative supercoiling favors strand separation, and DNA replication, transcription, recombination and repair, all of which involve strand separation.

FUNCTION: Protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Is able to repair glycated serum albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose biphosphate aldolase. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of Schiff bases and advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) (PubMed:26102038, PubMed:26774339). Has been reported to display chaperone, peptidase and glutathione-independent glyoxalase activities (PubMed:12235139, PubMed:12565879, PubMed:14731284, PubMed:15550391, PubMed:7848303, PubMed:21696459). However, these apparently disparate activities are all recruited to execute its protein deglycase primary function (PubMed:26102038, PubMed:26774339).

Binds to 50S ribosomal subunits, preventing them from associating with 30S subunits to form 70S ribosomes and reducing polysomes. It does not cause ribosomes to dissociate however. The antibiotic paromomycin blocks the anti-association activity of RatA. Overexpression results in inhibition of growth in liquid cultures, and in a decrease in protein translation. The other gene of this operon, ratB, is not the cognate antitoxin in this strain; in CFT073 however it does fulfill this function.; FUNCTION: Low level expression in a deletion mutant increases resistance to acidified sodium nitrate which causes nitrosative stress.	4 out of 5	Chain (1)	
Q47149	yafQ		b0225 JW0215	mRNA interferase YafQ (EC 3.1.-.-) (Endoribonuclease YafQ) (Toxin YafQ)	3.1.-.-		FUNCTION: Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation elongation and induces bacterial stasis. Cleavage occurs between the second and third residue of the Lys codon followed by a G or A (5'AAA(G/A)3'), is reading-frame dependent and occurs within the 5' end of most mRNAs. Ribosome-binding confers the sequence specificity and reading frame-dependence. When overexpressed in liquid media YafQ partially inhibits protein synthesis, with a reduction in growth rate and colony growth rate. This effect is counteracted by coexpression with DinJ, the YafQ antitoxin. YafQ and DinJ together bind their own promoter, and by analogy to other TA modules probably repress its expression.; FUNCTION: Cell death governed by the MazE-MazF and DinJ-YafQ TA modules seems to play a role in biofilm formation.	5 out of 5	Active site (1); Beta strand (4); Chain (1); Helix (5); Mutagenesis (1)

P06616	era	rbaA sdgE	b2566 JW2550	GTPase Era (ERA) (GTP-binding protein Era)			FUNCTION: An essential GTPase that binds both GDP and GTP, with nucleotide exchange occurring on the order of seconds whereas hydrolysis occurs on the order of minutes. Plays a role in numerous processes, including cell cycle regulation, energy metabolism, as a chaperone for 16S rRNA processing and 30S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Its presence in the 30S subunit may prevent translation initiation. Seems to be critical for maintaining cell growth and cell divison rates; a dramatic reduction in Era protein levels temporarily arrests cell growth just before cytokinesis (at the predivisional two-cell stage) and delays cell division. Era mutant era1 suppresses some temperature-sensitive mutations that affect DNA replication and chromosome partitioning and segregation. The dominant-negative Era-de mutant which is missing residues in a putative effector region, is unable to complement the disruption mutant; upon overproduction it shows a significant decrease in cell viability and a synthetic lethal phenotype in the presence of acetate. Era function probably overlaps RbfA. Binds to the pre-30S subunit through several stages of protein assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12753192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16825789, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20188109, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9515700}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (12); Chain (1); Domain (2); Helix (11); Initiator methionine (1); Mass spectrometry (1); Modified residue (2); Mutagenesis (8); Nucleotide binding (3); Turn (2)	MISCELLANEOUS: When overexpressed partially suppresses the slow growth and decreased 70S ribosome phenotype of an rsgA knockout; RsgA may be involved in 30S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. When overexpressed partially suppresses the ribosome assembly defects and cold-sensitivity of an rbfA knockout; an era mutant missing residues 40-49 fully suppresses these phenotypes. RbfA plays a role in 30S ribosomal subunit maturation. Overexpression is not able to suppress a rimM disruption phenotype nor a C23U mutation in 16S rRNA. Also suppresses temperature-sensitive mutations in DNA primase.

Is able to repair glycated serum albumin, collagen, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose biphosphate aldolase. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of Schiff bases and advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:26774339). Displays a covalent chaperone activity with sulfenylated thiol proteins by forming mixed disulfides with members of the thiol proteome, and preferentially with sulfenylated cellular proteins, upon oxidative stress; these mixed disulfides can be subsequently reduced by low-molecular-weight thiols to regenerate YajL and reduced proteins (PubMed:22157000, PubMed:22321799).

P0AE72	mazE	chpAI chpR	b2783 JW2754	Antitoxin MazE			FUNCTION: Antitoxin component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Labile antitoxin that binds to the MazF endoribonuclease toxin and neutralizes its endoribonuclease activity. Is considered to be an 'addiction' molecule as the cell dies in its absence. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium the overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death. Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Both MazE and MazE-MazF bind to the promoter region of the mazE-mazF operon to inhibit their own transcription (PubMed:8650219). There are 3 operators to which MazE binds (PubMed:12533537). MazE has higher affinity for promoter DNA in the presence of MazF (PubMed:25564525). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11071896, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12123459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12533537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19707553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21419338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25564525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8650219}.; FUNCTION: Cell death governed by the MazE-MazF and DinJ-YafQ TA modules seems to play a role in biofilm formation, while MazE-MazF is also implicated in cell death in liquid media. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576778, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19707553}.; FUNCTION: Might also serve to protect cells against bacteriophage; in the presence of MazE-MazF fewer P1 phage are produced than in a disrupted strain. For strain K38 most wild-type cells are killed but not by phage lysis; it was suggested that MazE-MazF causes P1 phage exclusion from the bacterial population.

P69348	yoeB		b4539 JW5331	Toxin YoeB (EC 3.1.-.-) (Putative endoribonuclease YoeB) (Putative mRNA interferase Yoeb)	3.1.-.-		FUNCTION: Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Its mode of function is controversial; it has been proposed to be an mRNA interferase but also an inhibitor of translation initiation. When overproduced in wild-type cells, inhibits bacterial growth and translation by cleavage of mRNA molecules while it has a weak effect on colony forming ability. Overproduction of Lon protease specifically activates YoeB-dependent mRNA cleavage, leading to lethality. YefM binds to the promoter region of the yefM-yeoB operon to repress transcription, YeoB acts as a corepressor.; FUNCTION: Shown in vitro to be an mRNA interferase that requires translation for substrate cleavage; if the mRNA is mutated so as to not be translatable it is no longer cleaved. Cleavage only occurs within translated regions. Has RNase activity and preferentially cleaves at the 3'-end of purine ribonucleotides.; FUNCTION: Also shown in vitro to be a translation initiation blocker. Binds to the 70S ribosome and 50S ribosomal subunit; binding is inhibited by hygromycin A and tetracycline, both of which bind to the 30S subunit in the A site. Thus YoeB is located at the interface between 50S and 30S ribosomes and interacts with the A site where it cleaves mRNA, blocking translation initiation.	5 out of 5	Active site (2); Beta strand (4); Chain (1); Helix (3); Mutagenesis (3)

CRISPR clusters contain sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The Cas1-Cas2 complex is involved in CRISPR adaptation, the first stage of CRISPR immunity, being required for the addition/removal of CRISPR spacers at the leader end of the CRISPR locus (PubMed:24920831, PubMed:25707795, PubMed:24793649). The Cas1-Cas2 complex introduces staggered nicks into both strands of the CRISPR array near the leader repeat and joins the 5'-ends of the repeat strands with the 3'-ends of the new spacer sequence (PubMed:24920831). Spacer DNA integration requires supercoiled target DNA and 3'-OH ends on the inserted (spacer) DNA and probably initiates with a nucleophilic attack of the C 3'-OH end of the protospacer on the minus strand of the first repeat sequence (PubMed:25707795). Expression of Cas1-Cas2 in a strain lacking both genes permits spacer acquisition (PubMed:24793649, PubMed:24920831). Cas2 not seen to bind DNA alone; the Cas1-Cas2 complex preferentially binds CRISPR-locus DNA (PubMed:24793649). Highest binding is seen to a dual forked DNA complex with 3'-overhangs and a protospacer-adjacent motif-complement specifically positioned (PubMed:26478180). The protospacer DNA lies across a flat surface extending from 1 Cas1 dimer, across the Cas2 dimer and contacting the other Cas1 dimer; the 23 bp-long ds section of the DNA is bracketed by 1 Tyr-22 from each of the Cas1 dimers (PubMed:26478180, PubMed:26503043). Cas1 cuts within the 3'-overhang, to generate a 33-nucleotide DNA that is probably incorporated into the CRISPR leader by a cut-and-paste mechanism (PubMed:26478180). This subunit's probable nuclease activity is not required for spacer acquisition (PubMed:24793649). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21255106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24793649, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24920831, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26478180}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (8); Chain (1); Helix (2); Mutagenesis (17)

CRISPR clusters contain sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA).; FUNCTION: A component of Cascade, which participates in CRISPR interference, the third stage of CRISPR immunity. Cascade binds both crRNA and in a sequence-specific manner negatively supercoiled dsDNA target. This leads to the formation of an R-loop in which the crRNA binds the target DNA, displacing the noncomplementary strand. Cas3 is recruited to Cascade, nicks target DNA and then unwinds and cleaves the target, leading to DNA degradation and invader neutralization.

Only unfolded proteins devoid of disulfide bonds appear capable of being cleaved, thereby preventing non-specific proteolysis of folded proteins (PubMed:8830688). Its proteolytic activity is essential for the survival of cells at elevated temperatures (PubMed:7557477). It can degrade IciA, Ada, casein, globin and PapA. DegP shares specificity with DegQ (PubMed:8830688).

P64524	cbtA	yeeV	b2005 JW1987	Cytoskeleton-binding toxin CbtA (Toxin CbtA) (Toxin YeeV)			FUNCTION: Toxic component of a type IV toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Interacts with cytoskeletal proteins FtsZ and MreB; inhibits FtsZ GTP-dependent polymerization and GTPase activity as well as MreB ATP-dependent polymerization. Binds to both the N- and C-terminus of FtsZ, likely blocking its polymerization. Overexpression results in inhibition of growth in liquid cultures and decrease in colony formation; these effects are overcome by concomitant expression of antitoxin CbeA (YeeU). In other experiments after 6 hours cells are lemon-shaped and by 24 hours those that have not lysed are spherical with diminished polar regions. Toxic effects are neutralized by cognate antitoxin CbeA, although there is no direct interaction between the 2 proteins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14594833, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21166897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22515815}.	4 out of 5	Chain (1); Mutagenesis (1); Region (2)

P09372	grpE		b2614 JW2594	Protein GrpE (HSP-70 cofactor) (HSP24) (Heat shock protein B25.3)			FUNCTION: Participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured proteins, in association with DnaK and GrpE. It is the nucleotide exchange factor for DnaK and may function as a thermosensor. Unfolded proteins bind initially to DnaJ; upon interaction with the DnaJ-bound protein, DnaK hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting in the formation of a stable complex. GrpE releases ADP from DnaK; ATP binding to DnaK triggers the release of the substrate protein, thus completing the reaction cycle. Several rounds of ATP-dependent interactions between DnaJ, DnaK and GrpE are required for fully efficient folding. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15102842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8890154}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (8); Chain (1); Helix (5); Mutagenesis (18); Site (1); Turn (1)

Binds the periplasmic domain of sensor histidine kinase CpxA, inhibiting induction of the Cpx envelope stress response in the absence of inducer; overexpression decreases Cpx pathway activity (PubMed:16166523, PubMed:21317318). Some periplasmic stimulii (shown for P pili subunit PapE and probably 0.3 M NaCl) increase CpxP's susceptibility to DegP, leading to CpxP degradation, inducing the Cpx pathway (PubMed:16166523, PubMed:16303867). Aids in combating extracytoplasmic protein-mediated toxicity (PubMed:9473036, PubMed:16303867, PubMed:21239493). Overexpression leads to degradation by DegP of misfolded P pili subunits in the periplasm (tested using PapE) (PubMed:21239493).

P0ACJ8	crp	cap csm	b3357 JW5702	cAMP-activated global transcriptional regulator CRP (Catabolite activator protein) (CAP) (Catabolite gene activator) (cAMP receptor protein) (CRP) (cAMP regulatory protein)			FUNCTION: A global transcription regulator. Complexes with cyclic AMP (cAMP) which allosterically activates DNA binding (to consensus sequence 5'-AAATGTGATCTAGATCACATTT-3') to directly regulate the transcription of about 300 genes in about 200 operons and indirectly regulate the expression of about half the genome. There are 3 classes of CRP promoters; class I promoters have a single CRP-binding site upstream of the RNA polymerase (RNAP)-binding site, whereas in class II promoters the single CRP- and RNAP-binding site overlap, CRP making multiple contacts with RNAP. Class III promoters require multiple activator molecules, including at least one CRP dimer. It can act as an activator, repressor, coactivator or corepressor. Induces a severe bend in DNA (about 87 degrees), bringing upstream promoter elements into contact with RNAP. Acts as a negative regulator of its own synthesis as well as for adenylate cyclase (cyaA), which generates cAMP. High levels of active CRP are detrimental to growth (PubMed:16260780). Plays a major role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR). CCR involves cAMP, adenylate cyclase (cyaA), CRP and the EIIA-Glc component of the PTS (crr). In the presence of glucose EIIA-Glc is dephosphorylated, and does not activate adenylate cyclase, leading to reduced cAMP and thus decreased CRP activity. Also plays a role in many other processes (see PubMed:22573269). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10860739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10860740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15520470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16260780, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16301522, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1646077, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2982847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7966284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8392187, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8978616}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (18); Binding site (1); Chain (1); DNA binding (1); Domain (1); Helix (7); Initiator methionine (1); Modified residue (1); Mutagenesis (23); Nucleotide binding (6); Region (3); Sequence conflict (1); Site (2)	MISCELLANEOUS: Binds 2 cAMP; cAMP 1 is in the anti conformation, while cAMP 2 is in the syn conformation. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:9096308}.
P0A9E5	fnr	nirR	b1334 JW1328	Fumarate and nitrate reduction regulatory protein			FUNCTION: Global transcription factor that controls the expression of over 100 target genes in response to anoxia. It facilitates the adaptation to anaerobic growth conditions by regulating the expression of gene products that are involved in anaerobic energy metabolism. When the terminal electron acceptor, O(2), is no longer available, it represses the synthesis of enzymes involved in aerobic respiration and increases the synthesis of enzymes required for anaerobic respiration.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); DNA binding (1); Domain (1); Mass spectrometry (1); Metal binding (4); Mutagenesis (35); Region (12)	MISCELLANEOUS: FNR senses the oxygen concentration directly via the disassembly and reassembly of the [4Fe-4S] clusters. Anaerobic, de novo acquisition of the iron-sulfur cluster converts monomeric, inactive apo-FNR into a dimeric form containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters. This, in turn, enhances the affinity of FNR for specific DNA targets and mediates transcription regulation by establishing direct FNR-RNA polymerase contacts. With the increase in intracellular oxygen concentration, the [4Fe-4S] cluster is oxidized, producing a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which decays to apo-FNR. Apo-FNR [4SH] can be reversibly oxidized to a disulfide form [2SH,S-S], suggesting that FNR may be able to sense oxidative stress as well as normoxia. This interconversion may be mediated by agents such as glutathione or thioredoxin.

In association with Crp, and probably in the presence of chitobiose 6-phosphate, induces the transcription of the chbBCARFG operon. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18028317}.	3 out of 5	Chain (1); DNA binding (1)	MISCELLANEOUS: Under prolonged growth on cellobiose as the sole carbon source, spontaneous mutations in chbR and nagC alter the regulation of the chbBCARFG operon, allowing the uptake and metabolism of cellobiose. The mutated regulator makes stronger contact with the target DNA sequence within the chb promoter and has enhanced recognition of cellobiose 6-phosphate as an inducer.
P0A9G8	modE	modR	b0761 JW0744	Transcriptional regulator ModE			FUNCTION: The ModE-Mo complex acts as a repressor of the modABC operon, involved in the transport of molybdate. Upon binding molybdate, the conformation of the protein changes, promoting dimerization of ModE-Mo. The protein dimer is then competent to bind a DNA region, upstream of the modABC operon, which contains an 8-base inverted repeat 5'-TAACGTTA-3' flanked by two CAT boxes. Acts also as an enhancer of the expression of genes coding for molybdoenzymes, both directly and indirectly.

In high periplasmic Mg(2+), PhoQ dephosphorylates phospho-PhoP, resulting in the repression of PAG and may lead to expression of some PRG (By similarity). Mediates magnesium influx to the cytosol by activation of MgtA. Promotes expression of the two-component regulatory system rstA/rstB and transcription of the hemL, mgrB, nagA, slyB, vboR and yrbL genes. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10464230}.	4 out of 5	Beta strand (6); Chain (1); DNA binding (1); Domain (1); Helix (5); Modified residue (1)	MISCELLANEOUS: There is a close linkage between the Rcs and PhoQ/P signaling systems, and both signaling systems respond to certain external divalent cations (zinc and magnesium).; MISCELLANEOUS: Two-component regulatory system EvgA/EvgS interacts with PhoP/PhoQ via signal transduction mediated by phospho-EvgA.

P0A8S1	argP	iciA	b2916 JW2883	HTH-type transcriptional regulator ArgP (Inhibitor of chromosome initiation) (OriC replication inhibitor)			FUNCTION: Controls the transcription of genes involved in arginine and lysine metabolism. Activates transcription of several genes, including argO, lysP, lysC, asd, dapB, dapD, lysA, gdhA and argK. Acts by binding directly to their promoter or control region (PubMed:10600368, PubMed:15150242, PubMed:17504942, PubMed:21441513, PubMed:21890697). ArgP dimer by itself is able to bind the argO promoter-operator region to form a binary complex, but the formation of a ternary complex with RNA polymerase is greatly stimulated only in presence of a coeffector. Both arginine and lysine are coeffectors at the argO promoter, but only arginine is competent to activate transcription. Lysine has repressive effects (PubMed:15150242, PubMed:17504942). ArgP also mediates lysine repression of dapB, and gdhA in vivo, but via an alternative mechanism: ArgP binding is directly reduced upon the addition of lysine (PubMed:21890697). Binds in vitro to the promoter region of dnaA and to the upstream region of the nrd promoter, but these genes are probably not regulated by ArgP in vivo (PubMed:9254708, PubMed:9819053, PubMed:21890697). In vitro, binds also to the three 13-mers located in the origin region (oriC) and blocks the initiation of replication (PubMed:1733927). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10600368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15150242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1733927, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17504942, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21441513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21890697, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9254708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9819053}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); DNA binding (1); Domain (1)

P0ACF8	hns	bglY cur drdX hnsA msyA osmZ pilG topS	b1237 JW1225	DNA-binding protein H-NS (Heat-stable nucleoid-structuring protein) (Histone-like protein HLP-II) (Protein B1) (Protein H1)			FUNCTION: A DNA-binding protein implicated in transcriptional repression (silencing) (PubMed:333393, PubMed:2128918, PubMed:8890170, PubMed:8913298, PubMed:9398522, PubMed:16963779, PubMed:17046956, PubMed:23543115). Also involved in bacterial chromosome organization and compaction (PubMed:6379600, PubMed:10982869, PubMed:21903814). H-NS binds tightly to AT-rich dsDNA and inhibits transcription (PubMed:2512122, PubMed:16963779, PubMed:17435766, PubMed:17881364, PubMed:23543115). Binds upstream and downstream of initiating RNA polymerase, trapping it in a loop and preventing transcription (PubMed:11714691). Binds to hundreds of sites, approximately half its binding sites are in non-coding DNA, which only accounts for about 10% of the genome (PubMed:16963779, PubMed:17046956, PubMed:23543115). Many of these loci were horizontally transferred (HTG); this offers the selective advantage of silencing foreign DNA while keeping it in the genome in case of need (PubMed:17046956, PubMed:17881364, PubMed:26789284). Suppresses transcription at many intragenic sites as well as transcription of spurious, non-coding RNAs genome-wide (PubMed:24449106). Repression of HTG by H-NS is thought to allow their DNA to evolve faster than non-H-NS-bound regions, and facilitates integration of HTG into transcriptional regulatory networks (PubMed:26789284). A subset of H-NS/StpA-regulated genes also require Hha (and/or Cnu, ydgT) for repression; Hha and Cnu increase the number of genes DNA bound by H-NS/StpA and may also modulate the oligomerization of the H-NS/StpA-complex (PubMed:23543115). The protein forms 2 clusters in the nucleoid which gather hns-bound loci together, bridging non-contiguous DNA, and causes DNA substantial condensation (PubMed:21903814). Binds DNA better at low temperatures than at 37 degrees Celsius; AT-rich sites nucleate H-NS binding, further DNA-binding is cooperative and this cooperativity decreases with rising temperature (PubMed:17435766, PubMed:17881364). Transcriptional repression can be inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of StpA or itself (PubMed:8755860). May effect transcriptional elongation (PubMed:25638302). Can increase translational efficiency of mRNA with suboptimal Shine-Dalgarno sequences (PubMed:20595230). Plays a role in the thermal control of pili and adhesive curli fimbriae production, by inducing transcription of csgD (PubMed:17010156). Plays a role in flagellar function (PubMed:11031114). Represses the CRISPR-cas promoters, permits only weak transcription of the crRNA precursor; its repression is antagonized by LeuO (PubMed:20132443, PubMed:20659289). Binds preferentially to the upstream region of its own gene recognizing two segments of DNA on both sides of a bend centered around -150 (PubMed:7934818). Overexpression suppresses secY24, a temperature-sensitive mutation (PubMed:1537791). Has also been reported to activate transcription of some genes (PubMed:4566454, PubMed:338303, PubMed:2128918). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10982869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11031114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11714691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1537791, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16963779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17010156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17046956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17435766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17881364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20132443, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20595230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20659289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2128918, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21903814, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23543115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24449106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2512122, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26789284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:333393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:338303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:4566454, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6379600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7934818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8755860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8890170, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8913298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9398522, ECO:0000305|PubMed:25638302}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (3); Chain (1); Coiled coil (1); DNA binding (1); Helix (5); Initiator methionine (1); Mass spectrometry (1); Mutagenesis (36); Region (2); Site (1); Turn (2)

In the presence of the R subunit the complex can also act as an endonuclease, binding to the same target sequence but cutting the DNA some distance from this site. Whether the DNA is cut or modified depends on the methylation state of the target sequence. When the target site is unmodified, the DNA is cut. When the target site is hemimethylated, the complex acts as a maintenance MTase modifying the DNA so that both strands become methylated.

P75993	ariR	ymgB	b1166 JW1153	Probable two-component-system connector protein AriR			FUNCTION: Probably a connector protein for RcsB/C regulation of biofilm and acid-resistance, providing additional signal input into the two-component signaling pathway. May serve to stimulate biofilm maturation, via the Rcs phosphorelay. Regulates expression of genes involved in acid-resistance and biofilm formation, including the RcsB/C two-component system. May be a non-specific DNA-binding protein that binds genes and/or intergenic regions via a geometric recognition. Also confers resistance to H(2)O(2). Overexpression at 28 and 16 degrees Celsius increases the production of colanic acid, an exopolysaccharide and matrix component, and reduces adhesive curli fimbriae expression. Both of these effects require RcsB; AriR probably acts upstream of the RcsB/C system to stimulate the activity and not transcription of RcsB/C. 5-fluorouracil reduction in biofilm formation requires this protein. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17765265}.	4 out of 5	Chain (1); Helix (3)

FUNCTION: This enzyme has three activities: DNA binding, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) adenylyltransferase and ribosylnicotinamide (RN) kinase. The DNA-binding domain binds to the nadB operator sequence in an NAD- and ATP-dependent manner. As NAD levels increase within the cell, the affinity of NadR for the nadB operator regions of nadA, nadB, and pncB increases, repressing the transcription of these genes. The RN kinase activity catalyzes the phosphorylation of RN to form nicotinamide ribonucleotide. The NMN adenylyltransferase activity catalyzes the transfer of the AMP moiety of ATP to nicotinamide ribonucleotide to form NAD(+). The NMN adenylyltransferase domain also functions as the NAD and ATP sensor. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10464228}.	5 out of 5	Binding site (2); Chain (1); DNA binding (1); Domain (1); Erroneous initiation (1); Nucleotide binding (6); Region (2)	
Q46864	mqsA	ygiT	b3021 JW2989	Antitoxin MqsA			FUNCTION: Antitoxin component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Labile antitoxin that binds to the MqsR mRNA interferase toxin and neutralizes its endoribonuclease activity. Overexpression prevents MqsR-mediated cessation of cell growth and inhibition of cell proliferation. Initially reported to act as a cotranscription factor with MqsA (PubMed:19690171, PubMed:20105222). Following further experiments, the MqsR-MqsA complex does not bind DNA and all reported data are actually due to a small fraction of free MqsA alone binding DNA. Addition of MqsR to a preformed MqsA-promoter DNA complex causes dissociation of the MqsA-DNA complex, probably causing derepression of MqsA-repressed transcripts (PubMed:23172222). MqsA binds to 2 palindromes in the promoter region of the mqsRA operon activating its transcription. Binds to other promoters, inducing mcbR and spy and repressing cspD among others (PubMed:20105222). Binds to and represses the rpoS promoter, the master stress regulator, resulting in decreased cyclic-di-GMP, reduced stress resistance, increased cell motility and decreased biofilm formation; in these experiments 5 TA modules are missing (lacks MazEF, RelEB, ChpB, YoeB-YefM, YafQ-DinJ) (PubMed:21516113). An earlier study showed overexpression alone increases biofilm formation, perhaps by repressing cspD; in these experiments the 5 TA modules are present (PubMed:20105222). Represses the csgD promoter. In the presence of stress, when this protein is degraded, the promoters it represses are derepressed, leading to biofilm formation (Probable). This TA system mediates cell growth during bile acid deoxycholate stress by degrading mRNA for probable deoxycholate-binding protein YgiS; bile acid detergents such as deoxycholate are important for host defense against bacterial growth in the gall bladder and duodenum (PubMed:25534751). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19690171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19943910, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20105222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21516113, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23172222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25534751, ECO:0000303|PubMed:24212724}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (3); Chain (1); DNA binding (1); Domain (1); Helix (7); Metal binding (4); Mutagenesis (4); Turn (2)

P42641	obgE	cgtA obg yhbZ	b3183 JW3150	GTPase ObgE/CgtA (EC 3.6.5.-) (GTP-binding protein Obg)	3.6.5.-		FUNCTION: An abundant, essential GTPase which binds GTP, GDP and ppGpp with moderate affinity. Has high guanosine nucleotide exchange rate constants for GTP and GDP, and a relatively low GTP hydrolysis rate stimulated by the 50S ribosomal subunit. It is estimated there are 34000 molecules in log-phase cells and 5600 molecules in stationary-phase cells. Required for chromosome segregation. Plays a role in the stringent response, perhaps by sequestering 50S ribosomal subunits and decreasing protein synthesis (PubMed:19555460), and a non-essential role in the late steps of ribosome biogenesis, perhaps acting as a checkpoint for correct 50S subunit synthesis (Probable) (PubMed:24844575). Overexpression increases bacterial persistence (in exponential and stationary phase) in response to antibiotics (PubMed:26051177). Cells expressing high levels of Obg are more likely to form persister cells upon antibiotic exposure; this requires alarmone (p)ppGpp and acts via induced HokB, depolarizing cells, which probably reduces metabolic activity and induces persistence (PubMed:26051177). The persister phenotype can be separated from the essential phenotype (PubMed:26051177). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555285, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11976298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15836769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16980477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17578452, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17616600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19555460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26051177, ECO:0000305|PubMed:24844575}.; FUNCTION: Required for correct chromosome partitioning; in temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant nucleoids do not partition but remain in the middle of cell, cells elongate but do not divide. Overexpression protects cells against UV damage. Ts mutants have impaired plasmid and lamdba phage replication, possibly via effects on DnaA (PubMed:12826057). Regulates DnaA levels. Genetic interactions of Val-168 and a C-terminal insertion mutant with the double-strand break repair factors recA and recBCD, and with seqA suggests that ObgE, either directly or indirectly, promotes replication fork stability (PubMed:15721258). May protect replication forks from stress induced by toxic levels of hydroxyl radicals (PubMed:22863262). Initiation of DNA replication continues in ObgE-depleted cells. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555285, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12826057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12855728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15721258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16518617, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17578452, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22863262}.; FUNCTION: Binds to pre-50S ribosomal subunits in a salt-dependent manner. Acts as a ribosome anti-association factor; guanosine nucleotides stimulate ObgE 50S subunit binding and also ObgE-mediated 70S ribosome dissocation (GDP<GTP<GMP-PNP<ppGpp) (PubMed:24844575). Overexpression rescues an rrmJ deletion stabilizing the 70S ribosome. Even at permissive temperatures the ts mutant (Gln-80/Asn-85) shows disrupted 50S ribosomal subunit assembly, defects in 16 and 23S rRNA processing and altered association of some late-assembling ribosomal proteins (PubMed:11555285). Dissociates from the pre-50S ribosome under conditions of amino acid starvation. The levels of (p)ppGpp rise in the ts mutant (Gln-80/Asn-85), possibly because ObgE controls SpoT. Binds GDP and ppGpp with the same affinity. During ribosome assembly ObgE acts later than the rRNA methyltransferase RrmJ and DEAD-box RNA helicases DeaD and SrmB. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555285, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11976298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15292126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15836769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16980477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17616600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19555460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24844575}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); Domain (1); Metal binding (2); Mutagenesis (15); Nucleotide binding (5); Region (2)

Encoded together with proteins of the phosphate-specific transport (Pst) system in the polycistronic pstSCAB-phoU operon. PhoU is essential for the repression of the Pho regulon at high phosphate conditions. In this role, it may bind, possibly as a chaperone, to PhoR, PhoB or a PhoR-PhoB complex to promote dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoB, or inhibit formation of the PhoR-PhoB transitory complex.

P0ACG1	stpA	hnsB	b2669 JW2644	DNA-binding protein StpA (H-NS homolog StpA)			FUNCTION: A DNA-binding protein that acts in a fashion similar to H-NS protein upon overexpression, represses a number of genes including the cryptic blg operon, hns, papB and the proU locus (PubMed:8890170). A subset of H-NS/StpA-regulated genes also require Hha for repression; Hha and Cnu (YdgT) increases the number of genes DNA bound by H-NS/StpA and may also modulate the oligomerization of the H-NS/StpA-complex (PubMed:23543115). Repression can be inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of StpA or H-NS (PubMed:8755860). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23543115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8755860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8890170}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Originally isolated as a suppressor of a splicing defect of the thymidylate synthase (td) gene from bacteriophage T4 (PubMed:1480493).

FUNCTION: Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Phosphorylates Glu-tRNA-ligase (GltX, on 'Ser-239') in vivo. Phosphorylation of GltX prevents it from being charged, leading to an increase in uncharged tRNA(Glu). This induces amino acid starvation and the stringent response via RelA/SpoT and increased ppGpp levels, which inhibits replication, transcription, translation and cell wall synthesis, reducing growth and leading to multidrug resistance and persistence. The hipA7 mutation (a double G22S D291A mutation) leads to increased generation of persister cells, cells that survive antibiotic treatment probably by entering into a dormant state. Wild-type cells produce persisters at a frequency of 10(-6) to 10(-5) whereas mutant hipA7 cells produce persisters at a frequency of 10(-2). Generation of persister cells requires ppGpp as cells lacking relA or relA/spoT generate fewer or no persister cells respectively compared to hipA7. Low level expression of HipA induces dormancy and depending on the protein level, can be toxic enough to reduce cell growth or even kill cells. Low levels of wild-type HipA lead to high beta-lactam antibiotic tolerance of the survivor cells, also dependent on relA and relA/spoT. The toxic effect of HipA is neutralized by its cognate antitoxin HipB. With HipB acts as a corepressor for transcription of the hipBA promoter; binding to DNA induces a 70 degree bend. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14622409, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16707675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17041039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19150849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23667235, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24095282, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6348026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8021189}.	5 out of 5	Active site (1); Beta strand (30); Binding site (1); Chain (1); DNA binding (1); Helix (20); Mass spectrometry (2); Modified residue (1); Mutagenesis (6); Nucleotide binding (4); Sequence conflict (3); Turn (1)

An autorepressor of relBE operon transcription. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity (PubMed:18501926, PubMed:22981948). Increased transcription rate of relBE and activation of relE is consistent with a lower level of RelB in starved cells due to degradation of RelB by protease Lon. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11274135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11717402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12123459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18501926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18532983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19707553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19747491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22210768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22981948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9767574}.; FUNCTION: Seems to be a principal mediator of cell death in liquid media. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19707553}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (2); Chain (1); Helix (4); Mutagenesis (9)	MISCELLANEOUS: A number of site directed mutants give rise to a delayed relaxed phenotype; RNA synthesis resumes 10 minutes after amino acid starvation, an unusually slow recovery from periods of starvation, accumulation of a translation inhibitor. {ECO:0000303|PubMed:2990907}.; MISCELLANEOUS: There are estimated to be 550-1100 RelB and 50-100 RelE molecules in rapidly growing cells of MG1655; as they have quite high affinity for each other (dissociation constant of 0.33 nM) there is probably less than 1 free RelE molecule per cell.

A translation-dependent mRNA interferase. Overexpression causes cessation of cell growth and inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of translation; this blockage is overcome by subsequent expression of antitoxin YafN. Overexpression causes cleavage of a number of mRNAs in a ribosome-dependent fashion. YafO binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit in the translation complex induces mRNA cleavage 3' to the region protected by the ribosome; YafO alone is not able to digest mRNA. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19617347, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19943910}.	3 out of 5	Chain (1)	
P0AE70	mazF	chpA chpAK	b2782 JW2753	Endoribonuclease MazF (EC 3.1.27.-) (Toxin MazF) (mRNA interferase MazF)	3.1.27.-		FUNCTION: Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific endoribonuclease it inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving mRNA and inducing bacterial stasis. It is stable, single-strand specific with mRNA cleavage independent of the ribosome, although translation enhances cleavage for some mRNAs (PubMed:18854355). Cleavage occurs at the 5'-end of ACA sequences, yielding a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and a free 5'-OH, although cleavage can also occur on the 3'-end of the first A (PubMed:15537630, PubMed:23280569). Digests 16S rRNA in vivo 43 nts upstream of the C-terminus; this removes the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence forming a mixed population of wild-type and "stress ribosomes". Stress ribosomes do not translate leader-containing mRNA but are proficient in translation of leaderless mRNA, which alters the protein expression profile of the cell; MazF produces some leaderless mRNA (PubMed:21944167). The toxic endoribonuclease activity is inhibited by its labile cognate antitoxin MazE. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death (PubMed:8650219, PubMed:11222603). MazF-mediated cell death occurs following a number of stress conditions in a relA-dependent fashion and only when cells are in log phase; sigma factor S (rpoS) protects stationary phase cells from MazF-killing (PubMed:15150257, PubMed:19251848). Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Both MazE and MazE-MazF bind to the promoter region of the mazE-mazF operon to inhibit their own transcription. MazE has higher affinity for promoter DNA in the presence of MazF (PubMed:25564525). Cross-talk can occur between different TA modules. Ectopic expression of this toxin induces transcription of the relBEF TA module operon with specific cleavage of the mRNA produced (PubMed:23432955). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11071896, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11222603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15150257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15537630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18854355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19251848, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21944167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23280569, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23432955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25564525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8650219}.; FUNCTION: Might also serve to protect cells against bacteriophage; in the presence of MazE-MazF fewer P1 phage are produced than in a disrupted strain. For strain K38 most wild-type cells are killed but not by phage lysis; it was suggested that MazE-MazF causes P1 phage exclusion from the bacterial population. This phenomenon is strain dependent. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15316771}.; FUNCTION: The physiological role of this TA module is debated. Programmed cell death (PCD) occurs when cells are at high density and depends on the presence of MazE-MazF and a quorum sensing pentapeptide, the extracellular death factor (EDF) with sequence Asn-Asn-Trp-Asn-Asn (NNWNN), probably produced from the zwf gene product glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (PubMed:17962566, PubMed:18310334). Cell death governed by the MazE-MazF and DinJ-YafQ TA modules seems to play a role in biofilm formation, while MazE-MazF is also implicated in cell death in liquid media (PubMed:19707553). Implicated in hydroxy radical-mediated cell death induced by hydroxyurea treatment (PubMed:20005847, PubMed:23416055). In conjunction with EDF prevents apoptotic-like death (ALD) in the presence of DNA damaging agents, probably by reducing recA mRNA levels in a non-endonuclease-mediated manner (PubMed:22412352). Other studies (in strains BW25113 and MC4100, the latter makes EDF) demonstrate MazF does not cause PCD but instead bacteriostasis and possibly a dormant state as well as persister cell generation (PubMed:24375411). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17962566, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18310334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19707553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20005847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21419338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22412352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23416055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24375411, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8650219}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (8); Chain (1); Helix (4); Mutagenesis (8); Region (2); Turn (1)	
P0C077	relE		b1563 JW1555	mRNA interferase RelE (EC 3.1.-.-) (Endoribonuclease RelE) (Toxin RelE)	3.1.-.-		FUNCTION: Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (PubMed:9767574). A sequence-specific, ribosome-dependent mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). In vitro acts by cleaving mRNA with high codon specificity in the ribosomal A site between positions 2 and 3. The stop codon UAG is cleaved at a fast rate while UAA and UGA are cleaved with intermediate and slow rates. In vitro mRNA cleavage can also occur in the ribosomal E site after peptide release from peptidyl-tRNA in the P site as well as on free 30S subunits (PubMed:12526800). In vivo cuts frequently in the first 100 codons, most frequently after the second and third base and rarely near the stop codon (PubMed:21324908). Overexpression of RelE results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and a sharp decrease in colony-forming ability which is neutralized by the labile cognate antitoxin RelB. Overexpression also sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the presence of bactericidal agents and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials) (PubMed:15576765). Plays a role in dormancy when expressed in high-density cells in the absence of antitoxin RelB; amino acid starvation and an unidentified extracellular factor promote dormancy, while expression of antitoxin RelB restores cell culturability (PubMed:22210768). Acts with RelB as a corepressor of relBE transcription, considerably increasing the repression of RelB alone. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity (PubMed:9767574, PubMed:19747491, PubMed:18501926, PubMed:22981948). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11274135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11717402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12123459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12526800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576765, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18501926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18532983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19747491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20005802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21324908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22210768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22981948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24251350, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9767574}.; FUNCTION: Seems to be a principal mediator of cell death in liquid media (PubMed:19707553).

Q46865	mqsR	ygiU	b3022 JW2990	mRNA interferase MqsR (EC 3.1.-.-) (Endoribonuclease MqsR) (Motility quorum-sensing regulator MqsR) (Toxin MqsR)	3.1.-.-		FUNCTION: Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. Plays a significant role in the control of biofilm formation and induction of persister cells in the presence of antibiotics. An mRNA interferase which has been reported to be translation-independent (PubMed:19690171, PubMed:19943910, PubMed:23289863). It has also been reported to be translation-dependent (PubMed:20041169). Cleavage has been reported to occur on either side of G in the sequence GCU (PubMed:19690171). Also reported to cleave after C in GC(A/U) sequences (PubMed:19943910). There are only 14 genes in E.coli W3110 (and probably also MG1655) that do not have a GCU sequence and thus are resistant to the mRNA interferase activity; among these is the gene for toxin GhoT. Overexpression of MqsR causes cessation of cell growth and inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of translation as well as increasing persister cell formation; these effects are overcome by concomitant or subsequent expression of antitoxin MqsA. Cross-talk can occur between different TA modules. Ectopic expression of this toxin induces transcription of the relBEF TA module operon with specific cleavage of the relBEF mRNA produced (PubMed:23432955). Regulates the expression of GhoT/GhoS, a type V TA module (PubMed:23289863). Persistence depends on toxin GhoT activity, which MqsR controls at the post-transcriptional level by selectively degrading the antitoxin ghoS segment of the ghoST mRNA (PubMed:23289863). Persister cells exhibit antibiotic tolerance without genetic change. Overexpression leads to a dramatic increase in tolerance to the antibiotic ofloxacin. This TA system mediates cell growth during bile acid deoxycholate stress by degrading mRNA for probable deoxycholate-binding protein YgiS; bile acid detergents such as deoxycholate are important for host defense against bacterial growth in the gall bladder and duodenum (PubMed:25534751). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19690171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19943910, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20041169, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23289863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23432955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25534751}.; FUNCTION: Initially reported to act as a cotranscription factor with MqsA (PubMed:19690171, PubMed:20105222). Following further experiments, the MqsR-MqsA complex does not bind DNA and all reported data are actually due to a small fraction of free MqsA alone binding DNA. Addition of MqsR to a preformed MqsA-promoter DNA complex causes dissociation of the MqsA-DNA complex, probably causing derepression of MqsA-repressed transcripts. Does not bind DNA in the presence or absence of MqsA (PubMed:23172222). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19690171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20105222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23172222}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (6); Chain (1); Helix (4); Mutagenesis (7); Turn (1)	
P62395	secM	srrA yacA	b0097 JW5007	Secretion monitor			FUNCTION: Regulates secA expression by translational coupling of the secM secA operon. Ribosomes translating the C-terminal region of secM can disrupt an RNA repressor helix that normally blocks secA translation initiation, derepressing the expression of secA. Translational pausing of secM at Pro-166 under secretion-limiting conditions increases the duration of the disruption and thus increases secA expression. This is controlled by interaction of the secM signal peptide with secA and the translocon, possibly by secA pulling the paused secM out of the ribosome. The arrest sequence (150-FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP-166) is sufficient to cause arrest of unrelated proteins. Elongation arrest can be alleviated by mutations in the 23S rRNA or in ribosomal protein L22.	4 out of 5	Chain (1); Erroneous initiation (3); Mutagenesis (7); Signal peptide (1)

A shift to low temperature also triggers a BluF-mediated relief of repression by BluR, suggesting BluF may serve as a thermometer. Blue light may act to increase the affinity of BluF for BluR, allowing it to be released from its operator. The protein has a reversible photocycle, and undergoes structural changes, probably in the EAL domain, in response to light. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15453820, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19240136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20141167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22783906}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); Domain (2); Mutagenesis (1); Region (1)	
P33647	chpB	chpBK yjfE	b4225 JW4184	Endoribonuclease ChpB (EC 3.1.-.-) (Toxin ChpB) (mRNA interferase ChpB)	3.1.-.-		FUNCTION: Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. ChpB is a sequence-specific mRNA and (weak) tmRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits protein synthesis and induces bacterial stasis. Cleavage is independent of the ribosome. Cleavage occurs at ACY sequences where Y is not C. The endoribonuclease activity is not as strong as that of MazF. The endoribonuclease activity (a toxin) is inhibited by its labile cognate antitoxin ChpS. Toxicity results when the levels of ChpS decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. Both ChpS and ChpB probably bind to the promoter region of the chpS-chpB operon to autoregulate their synthesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12972253, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16413033, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21419338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8226627}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1)	
P0ACP7	purR		b1658 JW1650	HTH-type transcriptional repressor PurR (Pur regulon repressor) (Purine nucleotide synthesis repressor)			FUNCTION: Is the main repressor of the genes involved in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides, regulating purB, purC, purEK, purF, purHD, purL, purMN and guaBA expression. In addition, it participates in the regulation or coregulation of genes involved in de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, salvage and uptake (pyrC, pyrD, carAB and codBA), and of several genes encoding enzymes necessary for nucleotide and polyamine biosynthesis (prsA, glyA, gcvTHP, speA, glnB). Binds to a 16-bp palindromic sequence located within the promoter region of pur regulon genes. The consensus binding sequence is 5'-ACGCAAACGTTTTCNT-3'. PurR is allosterically activated to bind its cognate DNA by binding the purine corepressors, hypoxanthine or guanine, thereby effecting transcription repression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1400170, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14741201, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2211500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2404765}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (16); Binding site (5); Chain (1); DNA binding (2); Domain (1); Helix (15); Initiator methionine (1); Mutagenesis (7); Site (1); Turn (2)	MISCELLANEOUS: The corepressors hypoxanthine and guanine bind cooperatively to single PurR sites in each subunit of the dimer, inducing a conformational change which increases the affinity of PurR for its DNA operator sites.

FUNCTION: Globin-coupled heme-based oxygen sensor protein displaying diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity in response to oxygen availability. Thus, catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) via the condensation of 2 GTP molecules. Is involved in the modulation of intracellular c-di-GMP levels, in association with DosP which catalyzes the degradation of c-di-GMP (PDE activity). Cyclic-di-GMP is a second messenger which controls cell surface-associated traits in bacteria. DosC regulates biofilm formation through the oxygen-dependent activation of the csgBAC operon, which encodes curli structural subunits, while not affecting the expression of the regulatory operon csgDEFG. DosC, but not the other DGCs in E.coli, also promotes the production of the exopolysaccharide poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) through up-regulation of the expression of the PNAG biosynthetic pgaABCD operon, independently of CsrA.; FUNCTION: Overexpression leads to an increased level of c-di-GMP, which leads to changes in the cell surface, to abnormal cell division, increased biofilm formation and decreased swimming (the latter 2 in strain W3110). In a strain able to produce cellulose (strain TOB1, a fecal isolate) overexpression leads to an increase in cellulose production.	5 out of 5	Active site (1); Beta strand (8); Binding site (2); Chain (1); Domain (1); Erroneous initiation (1); Helix (22); Metal binding (3); Mutagenesis (13); Site (4); Turn (1)

FUNCTION: A bis-(3'-5') cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) phosphodiesterase involved in regulating the levels of c-di-GMP that control cell motility (the flagella) and adhesion (adhesive curli fimbriae). The YhjH effect on flagella is controlled via the c-di-GMP-binding flagellar brake protein YcgR, however curli expression is not regulated via YcgR. Forms a network with different diguanylate cyclases (DosC, YeaJ, YedQ, YegE have been identified) to regulate c-di-GMP levels. Flagellar activity is high at low c-di-GMP levels whereas curli fimbria are induced at high c-di-GMP levels. Cyclic-di-GMP is a second messenger which controls cell surface-associated traits in bacteria. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11031114}.	3 out of 5	Chain (1); Domain (1); Frameshift (1); Mutagenesis (1)

When bound to c-di-GMP it binds to elements of the flagellar motor (MotA (PubMed:20303158) and/or FliG and FliM (PubMed:20346719), binding to FliM also occurs in the absence of c-di-GMP), causing the motor to slow down. Thus, increasing levels of c-di-GMP lead to decreased motility. Probably binds 1 c-di-GMP dimer per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11031114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16920715, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20303158, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20346719}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); Domain (1); Mutagenesis (8)

P46889	ftsK		b0890 JW0873	DNA translocase FtsK			FUNCTION: Essential cell division protein that coordinates cell division and chromosome segregation. The N-terminus is involved in assembly of the cell-division machinery. The C-terminus functions as a DNA motor that moves dsDNA in an ATP-dependent manner towards the dif recombination site, which is located within the replication terminus region. Translocation stops specifically at Xer-dif sites, where FtsK interacts with the Xer recombinase, allowing activation of chromosome unlinking by recombination. FtsK orienting polar sequences (KOPS) guide the direction of DNA translocation. FtsK can remove proteins from DNA as it translocates, but translocation stops specifically at XerCD-dif site, thereby preventing removal of XerC and XerD from dif. Stoppage of translocation is accompanied by a reduction in ATPase activity. Also stimulates topoisomerase 4 activity. Required for the targeting of FtsQ, FtsL and FtsI to the septum. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11703663, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11832210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15522074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16553881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18363794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19246541, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19854947, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20081205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21371996, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9723913, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9829960}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (18); Chain (1); Compositional bias (1); Domain (1); Helix (20); Mutagenesis (7); Nucleotide binding (1); Region (4); Sequence conflict (4); Topological domain (5); Transmembrane (4); Turn (4)

Involved in integration of membrane proteins that insert dependently and independently of the Sec translocase complex, as well as at least 2 lipoproteins. Its own insertion requires SRP and is Sec translocase-dependent. Essential for the integration of Sec-dependent subunit a of the F(0)ATP synthase, FtsQ and SecE proteins and for Sec-independent subunit c of the F(0)ATP synthase, M13 phage procoat and the N-terminus of leader peptidase Lep. Probably interacts directly with Sec-independent substrates. Sec-dependent protein FtsQ interacts first with SecY then subsequently with YidC. Sec-dependent LacY and MalF require YidC to acquire tertiary structure and stability, a chaperone-like function, but not for membrane insertion.

Also acts as a receptor for CDI with CdiA from E.coli strain 536 / UPEC, which does not have the same mode of toxicity as CdiA from strain EC93 (PubMed:23469034, PubMed:23882017). Susceptibility to CdiA-EC93 is dependent on E.coli BamA; replacing BamA with the gene from S.typhimurium LT2, E.cloacae ATCC 13047 or D.dadantii 3937 renders cells resistant to CdiA-EC93. Cells with BamA from another bacteria no longer form CdiA-EC93-induced aggregates with EC93 cells. A chimera in which E.cloacae extracellular loops 6 and 7 are replaced with loops 6 and 7 from E.coli is susceptible to CdiA-EC93 and to CdiA-CT from strain 536 / UPEC (PubMed:23882017). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18761695, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23469034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23882017}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (50); Chain (1); Domain (5); Helix (17); Mutagenesis (13); Sequence conflict (5); Signal peptide (1); Topological domain (16); Transmembrane (16); Turn (11)

Confers resistance to a diverse group of cationic or zwitterionic lipophilic compounds such as ethidium bromide, tetraphenylphosphonium, rhodamine, daunomycin, benzalkonium, rifampicin, tetracycline, puromycin, and to chemically unrelated, clinically important antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and certain aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Overexpression results in isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) exclusion and spectinomycin sensitivity. Transport of neutral substrates is electrogenic, whereas transport of cationic substrates is electroneutral. In addition to its role in multidrug resistance, confers extreme alkaline pH resistance, allowing the growth under conditions that are close to those used normally by alkaliphiles.

The serine trilactone serves as a scaffolding for the three catechol functionalities that provide hexadentate coordination for the tightly ligated iron(2+) atoms. EntE proccesses via a two-step adenylation-ligation reaction (bi-uni-uni-bi ping-pong mechanism). First, it catalyzes the activation of the carboxylate group of 2,3-dihydroxy-benzoate (DHB), via a reversible ATP-dependent pyrophosphate exchange reactions to yield the acyladenylate intermediate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-AMP. It can also transfer AMP to salicylate, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, gentisate and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzoate. In the second step, DHB is transferred from 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-AMP onto the phosphopantetheinylated EntB (holo-EntB) to form DHB-holo-EntB. Then this product will serve in the formation of the amide bond between 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) and L-serine.

FUNCTION: Member of the two-component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ involved in adaptation to low Mg(2+) environments and the control of acid resistance genes. In low periplasmic Mg(2+), PhoQ functions as a membrane-associated protein kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation and subsequently transfers the phosphate to PhoP, resulting in the expression of PhoP-activated genes (PAG) and repression of PhoP-repressed genes (PRG). In high periplasmic Mg(2+), acts as a protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates phospho-PhoP, resulting in the repression of PAG and may lead to expression of some PRG (By similarity). PhoP-regulated transcription is redox-sensitive, being activated when the periplasm becomes more reducing (deletion of dsbA/dsbB, or treatment with dithiothreitol). MgrB acts between DsbA/DsbB and PhoP/PhoQ in this pathway; the 2 periplasmic Cys residues of MgrB are required for its action on PhoQ, which then acts on PhoP. Mediates magnesium influx to the cytosol by activation of mgtA.

The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient.

It seems also to increase the sensitivity to low levels of aminobenzoyl-glutamate. May actually serve physiologically as a transporter for some other molecule, perhaps a dipeptide, and that it transports p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate as a secondary activity.

P0C0S1	mscS	yggB	b2924 JW2891	Small-conductance mechanosensitive channel			FUNCTION: Mechanosensitive channel that participates in the regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell, opening in response to stretch forces in the membrane lipid bilayer, without the need for other proteins. Forms an ion channel of 1.0 nanosiemens conductance with a slight preference for anions. The channel is sensitive to voltage; as the membrane is depolarized, less tension is required to open the channel and vice versa. The channel is characterized by short bursts of activity that last for a few seconds.; FUNCTION: The channel pore is formed by TM3 and the loop between TM2 and TM3. After a sharp turn at Gly-113, an alpha-helix (residues 114-127) is oriented nearly parallel to the plane of the putative lipid bilayer. On the intracellular side of the channel, the permeation pathway of MscS does not connect directly to the cytoplasm but instead opens to a large chamber that is connected to the cytoplasm. This chamber resembles a molecular filter that could serve to prescreen large molecules before they are allowed passage to the transmembrane pore. The TM1 and TM2 helices appear to be likely candidates for mediating the tension and voltage sensitivities of MscS. Gating requires large rearrangements of at least the C-terminus.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (8); Chain (1); Helix (6); Mutagenesis (6); Topological domain (4); Transmembrane (3); Turn (2)

The number of TatA protomers can vary so that the channel can adopt different diameters to accommodate substrates of various sizes. This enables TatA to pack tightly around substrate and prevents ion leakage during transport.; MISCELLANEOUS: Absence of TatA from the TatBC complex leads to the instability of the complex and the specific breakdown of TatB.

FUNCTION: Involved in the biosynthesis of the siderophore enterobactin (enterochelin), which is a macrocyclic trimeric lactone of N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-serine. The serine trilactone serves as a scaffolding for the three catechol functionalities that provide hexadentate coordination for the tightly ligated iron(2+) atoms. Plays an essential role in the assembly of the enterobactin by catalyzing the transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) moiety from coenzyme A to the apo-domains of both EntB (ArCP domain) and EntF (PCP domain) to yield their holo-forms which make them competent for the activation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) and L-serine, respectively. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939709, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9214294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9485415}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); Erroneous initiation (3); Metal binding (3); Sequence conflict (1)	MISCELLANEOUS: Deletion of the C-terminal 25 residues of EntB results in very strong decrease of the catalytic efficiency of EntD. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9214294}.

P75830	macA	ybjY	b0878 JW0862	Macrolide export protein MacA			FUNCTION: Part of the tripartite efflux system MacAB-TolC. MacA stimulates the ATPase activity of MacB by promoting the closed ATP-bound state of MacB, increases the capacity of MacB to bind macrolides such as erythromycin, and provides a physical link between MacB and TolC. When overexpressed, the system confers resistance against macrolides composed of 14- and 15-membered lactones but no or weak resistance against 16-membered ones. In addition, MacA binds tightly rough-core lipopolysaccharide (R-LPS), suggesting that the system could also transport R-LPS or a similar glycolipid. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11544226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17214741, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18955484, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21696464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23974027}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (14); Chain (1); Coiled coil (1); Erroneous initiation (1); Helix (6); Mutagenesis (5); Topological domain (2); Transmembrane (1); Turn (1)

P0AGA2	secY	prlA	b3300 JW3262	Protein translocase subunit SecY			FUNCTION: The central subunit of the protein translocation channel SecYEG. Consists of two halves formed by TMs 1-5 and 6-10. These two domains form a lateral gate at the front which open onto the bilayer between TMs 2 and 7, and are clamped together by SecE at the back. The channel is closed by both a pore ring composed of hydrophobic SecY resides and a short helix (helix 2A) on the extracellular side of the membrane which forms a plug. The plug probably moves laterally to allow the channel to open. The ring and the pore may move independently. SecY is required to insert newly synthesized SecY into the inner membrane. Overexpression of some hybrid proteins has been thought to jam the protein secretion apparatus resulting in cell death; while this may be true, overexpression also results in FtsH-mediated degradation of SecY.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); Intramembrane (3); Mutagenesis (14); Topological domain (11); Transmembrane (10)

P0AG90	secD		b0408 JW0398	Protein translocase subunit SecD			FUNCTION: Part of the Sec protein translocase complex. Interacts with the SecYEG preprotein conducting channel. SecDF uses the proton motive force (PMF) to complete protein translocation after the ATP-dependent function of SecA. The large periplasmic domain is thought to have a base and head domain joined by a hinge; movement of the hinge may be coupled to both proton transport and protein export, with the head domain capturing substrate, and a conformational change preventing backward movement and driving forward movement. Expression of V.alginolyticus SecD and SecF in E.coli confers Na(+)-dependent protein export, strongly suggesting SecDF functions via cation-coupled protein translocation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21562494}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); Mutagenesis (1); Region (1); Sequence conflict (2); Topological domain (7); Transmembrane (5)

Binds mRNA upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and helps it bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit; acts as an RNA chaperone to unfold structured mRNA on the ribosome but is not essential for mRNAs with strong SDs and little 5'-UTR structure, thus it may help fine-tune which mRNAs that are translated (PubMed:24339747). Unwinds dsRNA by binding to transiently formed ssRNA regions; binds about 10 nucleotides (PubMed:22908248). Has a preference for polypyrimidine tracts (PubMed:778845).

Evidence for its role; binds to tmRNA with very high affinity, is required for binding of tmRNA to 30S subunit (PubMed:11101533, PubMed:15340139). Thought to play a role only in translation of the tmRNA in vitro (PubMed:17392345). Evidence against its role; overexpression of whole protein or various S1 fragments inhibits translation, they have no effect on trans-translation, and an in vitro system with S1-less ribosomes performs trans-translation (PubMed:15340139, PubMed:17376482). In trans-translation Ala-aminoacylated transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA, product of the ssrA gene; the 2 termini fold to resemble tRNA(Ala) while it encodes a short internal open reading frame (the tag peptide)) acts like a tRNA, entering the A-site of the ribosome and displacing the stalled mRNA (which is subsequently degraded).

These indicate that the distal end of the stalk moves by approximately 20 angstroms (PubMed:12859903, PubMed:16272117). This stalk movement is thought to be coupled to movement of deacylated tRNA into and out of the E site, and thus to participate in tRNA translocation (PubMed:12859903, PubMed:16272117).

P0AD49	raiA	yfiA	b2597 JW2578	Ribosome-associated inhibitor A (Protein Y) (pY) (Ribosome associated factor Y) (Spot Y)			FUNCTION: During stationary phase prevents 70S dimer formation, probably in order to regulate translation efficiency during transition between the exponential and the stationary phases (PubMed:16324148). During environmental stress such as cold shock or excessive cell density at stationary phase, stabilizes the 70S ribosome against dissociation, inhibits translation elongation and increases translation accuracy (PubMed:11375931, PubMed:15219834). When normal growth conditions are restored, is quickly released from the ribosome (PubMed:11375931). Has been suggested to inhibit translation elongation by blocking the A-site (aminoacyl-tRNA site) (PubMed:11375931). Has also been suggested to inhibit translation initiation by blocking the A-site and P-site (peptidyl-tRNA site) of the ribosome (PubMed:15502846, PubMed:23420694). At 15 degrees Celsius binds 30S subunits and stimulates their association with 50S subunits into idle 70S ribosomes (PubMed:23420694). Crystallization with T.thermophilus 70S ribosomes shows it binds in the channel between the head and body of the 30S subunit, where mRNA, tRNAs, initiation factors IF1 and IF3 and elongation factor G would bind; this protein's extended tail follows the mRNA channel and probably prevents RMF binding, which would prevent ribosome dimerization (PubMed:22605777). This protein also stabilizes the 30S head relative to the rest of the ribosome, which may also prevent dimerization (PubMed:22605777). Counteracts miscoding (translation errors) particularly efficiently at magnesium concentrations close to those observed in vivo but less efficiently at higher concentrations (PubMed:15219834). Counteraction of miscoding was shown to be stronger than inhibition of translation, suggesting that the former activity could be the main function of this protein in vivo (PubMed:15219834). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10535924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11168583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11375931, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15219834, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15502846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16324148, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22605777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23420694}.	5 out of 5	Beta strand (5); Chain (1); Helix (3); Initiator methionine (1); Mass spectrometry (1); Modified residue (1); Region (2); Turn (1)	
P0AFW2	rmf		b0953 JW0936	Ribosome modulation factor (RMF) (Hibernation factor RMF) (Protein E)			FUNCTION: During stationary phase, converts 70S ribosomes to an immature dimeric form (90S ribosomes) which are converted to inactive 100S ribosomes (a process called ribosomal hibernation) by the hibernation promoting factor HPF (PubMed:7677746, PubMed:18174192). Inactivates ribosomes by covering the peptidyl transferase (PTase) center of the 23S rRNA and the entrance of peptide exit tunnel (PubMed:12473202, PubMed:15066119). However crystallization with T.thermophilus 70S ribosomes shows it binds near the 3'-end of the 16S rRNA near the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, where it would sterically hinder translation inititation (PubMed:22605777). In this crystal binding of RMF induces movement of the 30S head domain away from the rest of the ribosome, presumably so they would more easily form dimers (PubMed:22605777). Also involved in protection against heat stress, but this role is not dependent on the maintenance of ribosome dimers (PubMed:15278243). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00919, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12473202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15066119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15278243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18174192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19170772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7677746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8440252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9278503}.	4 out of 5	Beta strand (2); Chain (1); Frameshift (1); Helix (2); Sequence conflict (3); Turn (1)	MISCELLANEOUS: When cells are transferred to rich nutritious culture medium, RMF is quickly released from 100S ribosomes, which dissociate into 70S ribosomes (PubMed:12473202).

Der and RrmJ are likely to share a mechanism to stabilize 50S ribosomal subunits at a very late stage of 50S subunit maturation possibly by interacting with 23S rRNA or 23S rRNA/r-protein complex. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11976298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16930151}.	5 out of 5	Chain (1); Domain (3); Mutagenesis (11); Nucleotide binding (6)

FUNCTION: Catalyzes glutathione (GSH)-dependent reduction of glutathionyl-hydroquinones (GS-HQs) to the corresponding hydroquinones. Can use a variety of GS-HQs as substrates, such as GS-p-hydroquinone (GS-HQ), GS-hydroxy-p-hydroquinone (GS-HHQ), GS-methyl-p-hydroquinone (GS-MHQ), GS-menadiol, and GS-trichloro-p-hydroquinone (GS-TriCH). Also displays GSH-dependent disulfide-bond reduction activity toward HED (2-hydroxyethyl disulfide), and is able to catalyze DMA (dimethylarsinate) reduction. Exhibits no GSH transferase activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20388120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22686328, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22955277}.	5 out of 5	Active site (2); Beta strand (12); Binding site (1); Chain (1); Domain (1); Helix (15); Mutagenesis (4); Region (3); Site (2); Turn (8)	MISCELLANEOUS: The reaction mechanism of reduction of GS-HQs is believed to involve a redox-active Cys that attacks the sulfhydryl of GS-hydroquinone, forming protein-glutathione mixed disulfide bond and releasing the hydroquinone. A GSH comes in to regenerate the protein and release GS-SG to complete the reaction.

FUNCTION: Catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in the first two intermediates of riboflavin biosynthesis, which are highly reactive metabolites, yielding relatively innocuous products. Thus, can divert a surplus of harmful intermediates into relatively harmless products and pre-empt the damage these intermediates would otherwise do. Helps maintain flavin levels. May act on other substrates in vivo. Has no activity against GTP, nucleoside monophosphates or ADP-ribose (PubMed:25431972). Is Required for swarming motility (PubMed:17122336). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17122336, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25431972}.	4 out of 5	Beta strand (7); Chain (1); Helix (7); Mutagenesis (4); Turn (2)

FUNCTION: Phosphorolytic exoribonuclease that removes nucleotide residues following the -CCA terminus of tRNA and adds nucleotides to the ends of RNA molecules by using nucleoside diphosphates as substrates. Also acts to regulate the attenuation of PyrE.	4 out of 5	Chain (1)	MISCELLANEOUS: The gene in K12 strains MG1655 and W3110 (and also other derivatives of K12 W1485) has a frameshift mutation that leads to loss of activity, although the protein is translated. Thus in those strains rph is an expressed but non-functional pseudogene. For the functional protein without the frameshift mutation see AC P0CG18.

FUNCTION: Catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids.	5 out of 5	Binding site (2); Chain (1); Metal binding (2); Nucleotide binding (2); Region (1); Sequence conflict (1)	MISCELLANEOUS: E.coli contains genes for 3 AHAS isozymes: ilvBN, ilvGM and ilvIH. In strain K12 only the Val-inhibitable ilvBN and ilvIH are expressed; ilvGM has a defect that disturbs the ilvG reading frame. IlvG (this protein) is Val-resistant and is expressed in K12 strains having what used to be referred to as ilv0 mutations. The ilv02096 mutation (shown here, an insertion of 2 bp, PubMed:7015336) causes a frameshift which restores the open reading frame, permitting the expression of this isozyme.

FUNCTION: Catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) using the cofactor NAD. The first reaction step involves the formation of a hemiacetal intermediate between G3P and a cysteine residue, and this hemiacetal intermediate is then oxidized to a thioester, with concomitant reduction of NAD to NADH. The reduced NADH is then exchanged with the second NAD, and the thioester is attacked by a nucleophilic inorganic phosphate to produce BPG. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P0A9B2}.	4 out of 5	Active site (1); Binding site (6); Chain (1); Nucleotide binding (1); Region (2); Sequence conflict (2); Site (1)
